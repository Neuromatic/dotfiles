07:07         vypr │  he's using 24 hour time
07:07         vypr │  europe for sure
07:07         vypr │  considering the date arrangement

07:09         dcat │  was I the only one that bothered to check him out?
07:09         dcat │  session open with dcat lel
07:09         dcat │  does imgur strip images?
07:10     NeoTerra │  I wasn't paying attention, he did mention me once and say "girls are hard to find" or something
07:10         mxtm │  dcat: it strips a lot
07:10         mxtm │  also wait
07:10         mxtm │  notice the keyboard icon
07:10         dcat │  damn
07:10         mxtm │  in the corner
07:10         dcat │  yeah?
07:10         mxtm │  that means that he's probably using a non standard KB layout
07:10         mxtm │  or is switching between languages
07:10         mxtm │  and he has visual studio open
07:11        tbuck │  such windows
07:11         mxtm │  looks like a throwaway VM
07:11         dcat │  waaait a mintue
07:11         dcat │  look at the resolution
07:11         dcat │  that actually might be a wm
07:11         mxtm │  I know
07:11         mxtm │  it's a throwaway VM
07:11         vypr │  VirtualBox has that size ratio.
07:11     NeoTerra │  fuck well that's a bit of a dead end
07:12         mxtm │  nah the kb thing still applies
07:12         dcat │  damn this guy is really a tinfoil
07:12         mxtm │  what is that bug icon on his taskbar
07:12         dcat │  scrub all the shit we got by now
07:12         dcat │  date everything
07:12         dcat │  it's probably a trap
07:12         vypr │  what?
07:13         mxtm │  what type of trap
07:13         dcat │  I used to do it all the time
07:13         dcat │  change the date of the wm
07:13         dcat │  join random channels
07:13         dcat │  say it's current deskpot
07:13         mxtm │  yeah understandable that he'd change the date
07:13         mxtm │  he seems tinfoil af
07:13         mxtm │  but he uses windows
07:13         mxtm │  even in a wM
07:14         mxtm │  *VM
07:14         dcat │  he also spoke very highly of openbsd
07:14         mxtm │  eeh
07:14         mxtm │  he said windows was best
07:14         dcat │  what's worse is that he's really good at this shit
07:14     NeoTerra │  oi
07:14         dcat │  and he's got very similar opinions as me concerning a lot
07:14     NeoTerra │  there's a bosko trip on /g/

07:34         mxtm │  oh shit
07:34         mxtm │  that makes sense
07:35         dcat │  that would explain his bsd enthusiasm
07:35         mxtm │  yeah
07:35         mxtm │  definitely
07:35         mxtm │  and his name
07:35         mxtm │  bosko
07:35         mxtm │  but it seems too easy
07:35         dcat │  yeah
07:36         mxtm │  and his company seems too professiona

07:38         dcat │  >TODAY IS TROLL TUESDAY
07:38         mxtm │  so maybe he doesn't have a mature reputation
07:39         mxtm │  now we have to link this bosko to the hackforums bosko
07:39         dcat │  hm
07:40         dcat │  wait
07:40         dcat │  he was referring to him holding seminars or teaching

07:41         mxtm │  "FUCK BOSKO MILEKIC"

07:42         mxtm │  well we have a weak link
07:42         mxtm │  between our bosko, bosko milekic, and bosko on 4chan
07:42         dcat │  yeah
07:43         mxtm │  should we spam his twitter
07:43         mxtm │  i have a spam bot
07:43         dcat │  no
07:43         mxtm │  lol
07:43        tbuck │  yeah that would explain his talking down of bsd
07:43         dcat │  we need better sources
07:43         mxtm │  "DO YOU LIKE DIDDLING KIDDIES?"
07:43         mxtm │  yeah definiteily

07:43         mxtm │  yeah that is not something to do
07:43         mxtm │  ever
07:44   Neuromatic │  I think we got it
07:44         dcat │  how about we set a 72 hour limit
07:44         mxtm │  Neuromatic: how you sure
07:44   Neuromatic │  mxtm: feeling
07:44         mxtm │  Neuromatic: yeah I got a slight feeling
07:44         mxtm │  however
07:44         dcat │  in 72 hours if we're equally sure that it's him, we try getting in contact
07:45         mxtm │  if any of you can find him on those IRC networks though
07:45        tbuck │  lol that sounds like him
07:45         mxtm │  that'd be cool
07:45         dcat │  yeah
07:45         mxtm │  tbuck: lol where
07:46         dcat │  vpn/tor and join same networks

07:48         mxtm │  yeah if this guy is the real one
07:48         mxtm │  then we could easily dig up info on him
07:48         mxtm │  and then shit on his life
07:50         dcat │  yeah
07:50        tbuck │  sounds like he does that himself, insulting fellow developers n such
07:50        tbuck │  no need to burn bridges
07:50         mxtm │  yeah seriously though
07:50         mxtm │  "TODAY IS TROLL TUESDAY!!!!"
