06:21 Starting query in unixhub with 
06:21  > just used a ":" for testing
06:21  < huh
06:21  < oh
06:22  < haven't I sent you a token?
06:22  > If so, then i was away
06:22  < oh.
06:22  < email
06:22  > neuromatic@archlinux.info
06:23  < sent
06:23  > Thank you
06:23  < it's probably in your spamfolder lel
06:25  > alright works fine now
06:25  < good.
06:26  > indeed. I was searching for a new paste site with cli tool cause the unixhub tools are very outdated lol^^
06:26  < yeah
06:26  > I'd wriiten one in bash that uses curl, but C is much nicer
06:26  < I went for max speed on this one
06:27  > It runs with good speed
06:27  < yeah, absolutely.
06:27  < compared to the rest of the tools out there
06:28  > Most of paste tools are simply bloat, this one is not. I like that
06:28  < thank you.
06:29  < I go for non-bloat
06:29  < I'm just considering wheter or not to add file listing 
06:29  < yrmt wants it, but then again, he's the master of bloat
06:30  > Its a nice featureâ€¦ maybe optional?
06:30  < yeah, good idea
06:30  < #ifdef IOUP_LIST
06:30  > put it in config.h
06:31  < yeah
06:31  < or maybe I'll find a smart way to add it in the existing code
06:31  > so then the config.h is quiet useless. The token can be added to major code too
06:32  < yeah, that's what I was doing
06:32  < but yrmt wanted a config file
06:32  < so I made a compromise
06:32  > It makes code more readable if there are new features
06:32  < config file?
06:33  < or in ioup.c?
06:33  > genrally in C source a config.h makes code better organized imho
06:33  < yeah, but there's a certain limit to it too
06:34  < I find it rather useless if there's only 1 feature
06:34  < if there's 5+ options, then I think it's worth it
06:34  > your're right. But you dont know if anytime there will be more. 
06:34  > yea 
06:35  < I tend to follow the unix philosophy
06:35  < and not implement useless features
06:35  < now I need to fix it server-side though
06:36  > thats recommeneted if youre on UNIXhub :D
06:36  < heh
06:36  < I'm sorry to say that I don't think very many follow that philosophy here
06:36  < I think most just want to rice their desktop
06:37  > They can rice their desktop without being non-unix
06:37  < true
06:37  < I just think they don't care about anything other than rice
06:38  < or at least, a lot of them
06:38  > Well, yrmt is very active in many unix things
06:38  < yeah
06:38  > And most of our users are here because they saw nicely riced desktops
06:39  > >crshd
06:39  > mom
06:39  < heheh
06:39  < true.
06:39  > His desktops always looks so damn awesome
06:40  < yeah
06:40  < tbh, I'm not very good at ricing
06:40  > If there is not much on your desktop there can not be much style :D
06:40  < true
06:41  > That is the different between us and earsplit 
06:41  < yeah, I guess
06:42  > You're usin 2bwm?
06:42  < yeah
06:42  > gimme scrot bitch
06:44  < http://pub.iotek.org/p/8Ors1aU.png
06:45  > aw yeahr. No panels no nothing, just term and big borders. That is style bruh
06:46  < quality never goes out of style
06:46  > gawd damn right
06:47  > now I have a reason to use ioup :P
06:47  < yeah, I need to fix extension support though ;P
06:47  < currently only works in web frontend
06:48  > I see
06:48  > But its nice for free time
06:48  < I'll fix that soon though
06:48  < it's really nice for piping though
06:48  < df -h | ioup
06:50  > I think that is a very useful thing
06:50  < yeah
06:50  > alright nigga, i have to go sleep now its 07:50 here
