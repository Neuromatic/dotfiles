01:20        dami0 │  try not renaming the file, see what happens, or make it false xml
01:20       fenriz │  i named it "niggers"
01:20       fenriz │  does it have to end in .xml?
01:20         vypr │  fenriz: y u no json

01:20         vypr │  :C
01:21         vypr │  and yes, xml files need to end in xml.
01:23       fenriz │  i see
01:23       fenriz │  i took for granted that i named it "niggers"
01:23       fenriz │  and vim detected the syntax, i thought i was good to go.

10:04  thang1thang │  Yeah... It gets worse
10:05  thang1thang │  biologically, you get the most efficient SNS sleep around 2 hours after dusk, and for the first 2 sleep cycles after falling asleep (so about 3 hours). And you get the most efficient REM sleep from about 8-10am
10:05  thang1thang │  I never fall asleep early, so I miss out on the most efficient time of the day to sleep for SNS sleep, and I have to wake up before (or at) 8am every day, so I skip out on the most efficient REM sleep, which is even more important ;-;

10:48        venam │  for the wifi at home I always use static ip addresses, when I'm in the wild I go for wicd-curses

10:48         vypr │  yrmt: Its not hard at all.

12:57        venam │  z3bra: I pushed some new things into the master branch
12:58        venam │  also, if (ws == WORKSPACE_DEFAULT) return; why that?
13:00        venam │  things work fine if they are not related to the first group
13:04        z3bra │  venam, yeah, I pull that, and reworked my patch
13:05        z3bra │  Found easier to fork it: http://git.z3bra.org/cgit.cgi/2bwm
13:05        z3bra │  that line is because I need a group to be the fallback of the others
13:05         join │  exaem
13:05        venam │  also, try to check everywhere where there was a check for if the window was on the same workspace
13:06        z3bra │  oO
13:06        z3bra │  don't get it
13:06        dami0 │  \o
13:06        venam │  I noticed that snapping only work for windows that are on the same group, for example
13:06         join │  Jayro

13:07        dami0 │  \o
13:07        Jayro │  o/
13:07        z3bra │  Oh, okay
13:07        z3bra │  Yeah I didn't tested that
13:07        z3bra │  I didn't wnat to touch much of your code first
13:07        z3bra │  But i'll work on this ;)
13:07          yrmt│  yrmt|away
13:08        venam │  and the next/previous desktop foo should also be changed
13:08        venam │  more like completely removed in that case
13:08        z3bra │  Also, for the if (ws == WORKSPACE_DEFAULT) return;, it's because when you hide a group, the current group becomes WORKSPACE_DEFAULT
13:08        z3bra │  So I had to prevent this group from hiding
13:09        z3bra │  I know that it's a workaround, but I don't have a better idea atm ^^'
13:09        z3bra │  And for the next/prev workspace, you're right, if you plan to totally remove the old workspace behavior
13:09        venam │  but if I send a window to group 1 the whole group 1 disappears
13:10        venam │  and it can never come back
13:10        z3bra │  it's now fixed
13:10        z3bra │  (i guess, as I don't have this problem)
13:11        z3bra │  actually, you can still have the old behavior by using #define GROUP_WINDOWS false
13:11         quit │  Jayro
13:15        venam │  personally, I prefer workspaces
13:15        venam │  but if we can have the 2 of them that's great
13:15        z3bra │  that's the case actually :)
13:16        z3bra │  I'm actually using my modified version with groups
13:16        z3bra │  And it seems to work flawlessly
13:16        z3bra │  with both groups and workspaces
13:20        venam │  it bugs a lot when using the mouse
13:21        z3bra │  lel, didn't tested that too
13:22        z3bra │  Mmmh seems you can't move windows that are not in the current group 
13:23        z3bra │  Also, I wanted to ask, what's 'offset[]' meant for ?
13:23        venam │  for bars
13:23        z3bra │  Oh, okay
13:23     yrmt|away│  yrmt
13:23         yrmt │  hai
13:27        z3bra │  also venam, you'd like to add "-D_GNU_SOURCE" to cflags in the make file
13:28        z3bra │  So that you'll not get the asprintf warning
13:30        venam │  I know about that
13:30        venam │  it was present at first but we removed it
13:30        z3bra │  why ?
13:30        venam │  doesn't work everywhere
13:30        venam │  it's better to get the warning
13:30        z3bra │  okay
13:31        venam │  seems like you've been browsing the code a lot
13:31        venam │  it needs to be restructured
13:31        venam │  so the reading becomes easier
13:32        venam │  if you read it like a step-by-step execution you understand directly everything
13:33        z3bra │  I didn't read that much
13:33        z3bra │  most parts are pretty self-explanatory
13:34        z3bra │  And most function work in the same way
13:34        venam │  weren't you running cwm before?
13:34        z3bra │  that's a good looking code to me =) 
13:34        z3bra │  I was
13:35        venam │  you should read the whole code at least twice before making changes. It's not hard, the source is small compared to other big projects
13:36         yrmt │  z3bra: I like it that you look in the code
13:36        venam │  read it from the bottom-up
13:36         yrmt │  Finally somebody else is adding stuff to the WM!
13:36        z3bra │  :)
13:37        z3bra │  venam, I don't see the point of that
13:37        z3bra │  Most function are just the same or wrappers to other
13:38        venam │  it won't take time anyway to read it through
13:38        z3bra │  I think I get how the WM is working, how every window is watched by function, etc..
13:38        z3bra │  venam, I already read the finest part :p
13:39        z3bra │  but okay, if you think that will be helpful, I will
13:39        venam │  the hardest foo to understand are the mouse move and the drawborders
13:39        z3bra │  I just read the mouse move stuff
13:39        z3bra │  what's hard with it ?
13:39         yrmt │  mouse is alright
13:40         yrmt │  venam: when are you going to use bitfields for workspaces
13:40         yrmt │  so we don't have that stupid NULL array
13:40        z3bra │  bitfield ? why so ?
13:41        venam │  yrmt: IDK, I've never used bitfields for anything before. You want all the workspaces to fit in a byte?
13:41         yrmt │  ye
13:41        venam │  what would we gain? 1KB of memory? not even 1KB
13:42        venam │  10Bytes?
13:42         yrmt │  the code would look more clean?
13:43        venam │  but atm this array for the workspaces is an array of linked lists
13:43        z3bra │  ^
13:44        venam │  to convert it to a bitfield we would have to use something like groups
13:44        z3bra │  venam, even with groups, you need it
13:44        venam │  we can put all the windows in the same linked list
13:44        z3bra │  for, eg, deleting a window from a group, the said group must know which windows it has
13:44        z3bra │  And use the ->workspace attribute
13:44        venam │  loop through it and depending on the current group of the window the action is done
13:45        z3bra │  yeah sure
13:45        venam │  but this way the complexity grows higher
13:45        z3bra │  I'm not sure of that
13:45        venam │  because for each actions we would have to loop through all the windows
13:46        z3bra │  not wrong

21:45         BigE │  okh
21:45        dami0 │  at some point I thought the % was processor load
21:46         quit │  vompatti
21:46         BigE │  that wouldnt be that absurd though if it was a 16 core processor
21:46        dami0 │  oh, really?
21:47        dami0 │  it's 24 core. 
21:47         BigE │  8 core plus hyper threading
21:47         BigE │  or whatever
21:47         BigE │  anyways
21:47        dami0 │  I think it's 24 physical cores. nvm then
21:47         BigE │  depending on what tool you are using to report cpu usage
21:47         BigE │  it may report each core as 100%
21:47        dami0 │  that's what /proc/cpuinfo spits out.
21:47         BigE │  yeah
21:48         BigE │  so that means that most likely, there are about 15 cores pinned at 100% usage
21:48        dami0 │  that's 58% at 24 cores. It's an intel xeon
21:48         BigE │  nice!
21:48         BigE │  fucking xeons
21:48         BigE │  wait
21:48        dami0 │  it's not mine. but I have access to it :>
21:48         BigE │  is that on a single chip?
21:49         BigE │  i assumed so
21:49        dami0 │  model name      : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           E5645  @ 2.40GHz
21:49         BigE │  schoool cluster or something?
21:49        dami0 │  yh
21:49        dami0 │  el dingly
21:50        dami0 │  oh, it's 6 cores @ 12 threads
21:50         BigE │  so that is a dual chip computer
21:50        dami0 │  lel, I was dreaming
21:50         BigE │  causethe chip is only 6 physical
21:50         BigE │  and 12 logical
21:51         BigE │  i want 4 of these on one of those quad chip mobo's
21:51         BigE │  one day....
21:51        dami0 │  I cranked shit up to a trillion. takes like 7 seconds
21:52         BigE │  what are you computing?
21:52         BigE │  i wasnt paying attention before if you said
21:52        dami0 │  Monte Carlo integration with OpenMPI
21:52         BigE │  cool
21:52        dami0 │  basically, random numbers, then check if they fall under or over the function
21:52         BigE │  we are doing OpenMP, OpenMPI, and CUDA in my parallel computing class
21:53         BigE │  should be fun
21:53        dami0 │  it's all then integrated and stuff. problem is, >1million the seed it longer
21:53        dami0 │  <1million*
21:53         BigE │  lul
21:53        dami0 │  seed takes longer than the actual calculation.
21:53        dami0 │  I wish we were doing openmp. I could take that home with me
21:53         BigE │  openmpi is good as well
21:54         BigE │  cuda is pretty crazy as well
21:54        dami0 │  under about 10,000 the OpenMPI calls make it go from <1s for 1 proc to ~5 sec for >=2
21:54         quit │  Jayro
21:54         BigE │  this guy i have class with did a travelling sales man problem on his cpu that took 10 seconds to solve, and it ran in like 1ms on the gpu with CUDA
21:55        dami0 │  that's monte carlo
21:55        dami0 │  well, we call it that, to sound pretentious
21:55         BigE │  really?
21:55         BigE │  you fucking sluts
21:55        dami0 │  oh no, that was random walks, mah bad
21:55        dami0 │  or drunken walks or something
21:56         BigE │  wut
21:56        dami0 │  yeah, physics
21:56         BigE │  why not just call it by the actual problem name
21:56         BigE │  lul
21:56        dami0 │  monte carlo is a family of problems related to solutions by brute force with random numbers
21:57         BigE │  okay
21:57        dami0 │  so, drunken walk is a subset of Monte Carlo
21:57         BigE │  so basically what are know as NP-hard problems
21:58        dami0 │  NP-hard?
21:58         BigE │  means the best way we know to solve the problem is brute force
21:58        dami0 │  lel.
21:59        dami0 │  guess being a pick up artist is pretty similar

22:51      jjumbii │  yeah i don't feel like doing anything either

00:34         mxtm │  jjumbii, I am honestly not COMPLETELY sure
00:34         mxtm │  however yes you'd start with what dami0 said
00:34        dami0 │  cut hole for light
00:34         mxtm │  probably take apart a vape battery
00:34         mxtm │  rewire the button into the sharpie
00:34        dami0 │  you'd also need padding or something to holf it in place
00:34         mxtm │  ^

00:37         shix │  jjumbii: lol what
00:37         rude │  straight shaving your pubes makes you look like a bitch
00:37         mxtm │  jjumbii, by the way a eGo battery is somewhat of a noob battery, but the 650 mAh would be small so that's why it's in the sharpie
00:37        dami0 │  look weird as well
00:37         mxtm │  and rude, sigh, no fucking shit
00:38      jjumbii │  how would i go about making a vape for cheap
00:38        dami0 │  if you just clean shave and the rest of your ass is hairy
00:38         mxtm │  if y'all got vape questions though, ask me
00:38        dami0 │  jjumbii: light bulb
00:38         mxtm │  and jjumbii, what's the budget
00:38      jjumbii │  $30
00:38         shix │  dami0: those type of light bulbs got banned here i think
00:38        dami0 │  cough up like, 100-150 dollah get a magic flight launch box

00:42      jjumbii │  vape looks more fun, less harmful
00:42        dami0 │  oh, you're talking about cigs?
00:42      jjumbii │  my parents would actually be cool about it
00:42        dami0 │  or just straight up vaping weed?
00:42         shix │  neither
00:43         mxtm │  jjumbii, yep that's what I thought, and even though my parents wouldn't really be too cool about it (maybe I'll condition them to) it's nice and I have it hidden well

00:48         BigE │  steam machines are aimed at the same people who buy custom consoles and alienware PC's
00:48         BigE │  they are not for people who would otherwise build their own
00:48         shix │  lul, alieware pc's
00:49        tbuck │  yeah some of those seem super expensive for what they are
00:49        tbuck │  that bolt II, 2.5k... 
00:50        tbuck │  you could build such a nice rig with that amount of money

00:51       fenriz │  are nothing but ocmputers in a fancy tower right?
00:51         BigE │  they are aimed at people that want something to just work
00:51       fenriz │  if so, imma just build my own -_-
00:51         BigE │  without having to build themselves
00:51        dami0 │  of course they aren't, what's a builder pleb to do with computing?
00:52         shix │  jjumbii: id check with your laws first
00:52         shix │  unless your parents are buying it
00:52        dami0 │  heh: ibuypower
00:52         BigE │  shix: it is the internet, who gives a fuck
00:52      jjumbii │  shix: ^
00:53      jjumbii │  it's ebay lel
00:53        tbuck │  as long as you have a card i think they assume you are 18
00:53         mxtm │  jjumbii, check out the vapedojo starter kits, i think they're back in stock
00:53        tbuck │  or if youre using your parents, win
00:53         mxtm │  i ordered from fasttech and regretted it because it took forever and their stuff is really shoddy sometimes, so i just went to a real store and had help from a friend
00:53         mxtm │  (heh)
00:54      jjumbii │  tbuck: i would just use paypal
00:54         BigE │  what is the liquid that you put in the vapers made of?
00:54         BigE │  that would be my biggest concern
00:54         BigE │  nicotine and water is probably fine
00:54      jjumbii │  BigE: yeah i was wondering too
00:54         BigE │  but the flavors and shit
00:55      jjumbii │  it's probably just like koolaid
00:55         BigE │  is what i would worry about
00:55        tbuck │  the ones you get at most stores are like glycerin or some shit
00:55         mxtm │  BigE, it's PG and VG
00:55         mxtm │  look the acronyms up I'm busy lol
00:55         mxtm │  but yeah it's pretty damn safe actually
00:55        tbuck │  honestly most ecigs dry my throat
00:55         mxtm │  tbuck, which brands?
00:55        tbuck │  it gets scratchy
00:56         mxtm │  and it depends on the PG / VG mix for the throat hit
00:56        dami0 │  glycerin
00:56        tbuck │  ive only tried disposable shitty ones for when im stuck indoors n need to get my fix
00:56        dami0 │  well, the cheap ones certainly use glycerin.
00:56        tbuck │  although people are lying if they say it doesnt leave an odor
00:57         mxtm │  tbuck, ah yeah those ones are SHIT
00:57         mxtm │  and it doesn't really at all
00:57         mxtm │  $40 for my setup included the juice and replacement coils and all
00:58        tbuck │  it does though ive had people walk into the room and go WTF is that smell
00:58         mxtm │  and a bottle of juice is like $5
00:58         mxtm │  tbuck, mine just makes everything smell like sweet sweet vanilla, it depends on the flavor and how shitty the cig is
00:58        tbuck │  it leaves a smell tho, thats the point
00:59         mxtm │  tbuck, yeha, it goes away fast though, and it doesn't have the effects that lingering cig smoke does
00:59        tbuck │  i just dont find them all that enjoyable, i could never spend that much money on one
01:00         mxtm │  tbuck, i promise it's so much cheaper than real cigs, you just have to try a good one
01:00        tbuck │  yeah way better than lighting up a cig in the house obviously
01:00         mxtm │  definitely haha
01:00         mxtm │  and with a nice sweet or cool flavor, it is like a little air freshener
01:00        tbuck │  im addicted to cigs tho, not just nicotine
01:00         mxtm │  ah yeah
01:00        tbuck │  they just dont cut it
01:01         mxtm │  what other than the whole motion and nic and taste and stuff make it not cut it?
01:01         mxtm │  as in what specifically do you think is missing
01:01        tbuck │  even the nic buzz doesnt do it for me
01:01        tbuck │  just doesnt satisfy any urges at all
01:01         mxtm │  yeah most people seem to have bad experiences with the shitty ecigs and then give up on them :(
01:01         mxtm │  i can pm you the name of a nice place of helpful vapers and all who can help you out if you want to try
01:01         mxtm │  (offer stands for anyone)
01:03        tbuck │  ill just stick with my tar and shortened life span
01:03         rude │  ^

01:25        dami0 │  does termite select urls with keyboard?
01:25       libbro │  I tried using something other than terminator because...
01:25       fenriz │  yup
01:26       libbro │  >Java
01:26       fenriz │  transparency is overrated.
01:26       fenriz │  people who don tuse it right makes their system look so fuckin gugly
01:26       libbro │  And I felt that it was a bit too heavyweight
01:26       fenriz │  when done right, with right amounts, it's really amazing.
01:26       fenriz │  so sick of the "transparent all the things"
01:26       fenriz │  in unixporn.
01:26       libbro │  I wasn't using a lot of the features so I decided to go minimalistic
01:26       fenriz │  or any other site
01:26        dami0 │  I just do it for terminals
01:26       libbro │  fenriz: Yeah.. I don't really like it either
01:27       libbro │  ESPECIALLY for terminals
01:27       fenriz │  yup.
01:27      jjumbii │  fenriz: i used transparency everything

01:27       libbro │  jjumbii: So 2 months ago?
01:27       fenriz │  jjumbii: haha, that's understandable.
01:27       fenriz │  jjumbii: i was like that too when i first discovered the customizablility of linux
01:27       libbro │  I remember when I first used Ubuntu
01:27       fenriz │  i could practically see through the screen of my desktop, the first time i transparenc-ied all the shit on LM13.
01:27       libbro │  It wasn't a good experience
01:27         mxtm │  jjumbii, that nostalgia
01:28       fenriz │  libbro: hahah.  
01:28       fenriz │  libbro: i had a phase where i would sudo everything, and log in as root AND run sudo

02:56         rude │  across the air
02:57         BigE │   you can do whatever you want with it that operates between 70mhz and 6ghz
02:57         BigE │  so yes, you can use it as a packet radio, a gsm radio, 802.11, bluetooth, whatever

03:01         BigE │  well, that day will probablynever come

03:12         BigE │  walking meshnet
03:12         BigE │  ah, i just realized it has fixed frequencies
03:13        dami0 │  don't know if it's due to my governor, but dingly is faster than my i5 at doing that monte carlo :<
03:13        dami0 │  it's like more than 2 times as fast
03:13         BigE │  dingly?
03:13        dami0 │  the xeon based rig
03:14         BigE │  well
03:14         BigE │  that makes sense
03:14         BigE │  does it not?
03:14         BigE │  faster chip, more cores, larger cache
03:14        dami0 │  clock is slower
03:14        dami0 │  but I'll give you cache and cores
03:14         BigE │  orly
03:14         BigE │  well
03:15         BigE │  i guess the cores dont matter if you are not multi-processing
03:15         BigE │  is your processor a laptop?
03:15        dami0 │  no, 
03:15        dami0 │  it's a processor
03:15         BigE │  then it might be the governor
03:16        dami0 │  well, at same number of jobs, it's only slightly faster
03:16        dami0 │  and I can hear my fan go up and up for like, 10 seconds
03:16        dami0 │  so I guess it's the governor
03:16         BigE │  what governor are you using?
03:17        dami0 │  default
03:17         BigE │  hmmmm
03:18         BigE │  maybe you need to manually change it to either on demand or performance
03:18        dami0 │  I'm setting performance
03:18         BigE │  that is probably the best
03:18        dami0 │  but it doesn't seem to do anything much 
03:19        dami0 │  plus I'm at 32bits because for some reason I must've selected something wrong during the isntall
03:19         BigE │  LOL
03:19        dami0 │  I'll switch arch tomorrow and do a proper governor, see what changes
03:19         BigE │  that can do it i would think
03:19        dami0 │  BigE: I swear though, I just pressed enter
03:20        dami0 │  on the bootup for the installer, which usually selects 64
03:20         BigE │  ha
03:20         BigE │  ha
03:20         BigE │  ha

03:20        dami0 │  oh right, I used their graphical live system. that could've done it
03:20         BigE │  ha.
03:20        dami0 │  'cos the normal one wouldn't even boot.
03:21        dami0 │  this was parabola though, not arch. that's why

05:01         rude │  and was filled with goals that no one person
05:01         rude │  could ever hope to achieve or maintain
05:01         shix │  it was a good idea because seriously guys, who the fuck still likes to compile xorg on freebsd
05:01         shix │  rude: thats why they gave him money and a team lul
05:02         BigE │  yeah
05:02         BigE │  money
05:02         BigE │  and a team
05:02         BigE │  fucking idiot
05:02     NeoTerra │  you can download xorg binaries shix
05:02         shix │  yeah but ports were more up to date
05:02         rude │  did archbsd ever become usable
05:02         rude │  anyway
05:02         rude │  he really should have used openbsd or netbsd as the base
05:02         BigE │  it was usable, yeah
05:02         BigE │  barely
05:03      jjumbii │  damn shix
05:03         shix │  what jjumbii 
05:03      jjumbii │  lets make ubuntufreebsd
05:03      jjumbii │  i want that moneyz
05:03         shix │  they already have that
05:03         shix │  its called ghostbsd
05:03         shix │  i think
05:03         BigE │  ghostbsd isnt bad
05:03         BigE │  I used it before
05:03         shix │  and pc-bsd is out there too
05:03         rude │  or how about we make a fork of netbsd
05:03         rude │  and give it a usable package manager
05:04         BigE │  but it had a similar problem to archbsd, in that it only had like 3 maintainers
05:04         rude │  and some sort of pre-installed usable desktop environment
05:04         shix │  isnt that what yrmt has been trying to do?
05:04         BigE │  the most recent ArchBSd release was like 2 weeks ago
05:04         shix │  Amzo is probaly still working on it, or someone else took over
05:04         rude │  http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/devotion_to_duty.png
05:05         shix │  In the end, Amzo was a drunk. Do you really want a drunk to maintain the OS you use?
05:05        Jayro │  yes
05:05         rude │  fuck all these freebsd forks like archbsd, pc-bsd etc
05:05         rude │  cant people just put the time and effort into making freebsd more usable
05:06         rude │  and making progress in some of the major issues
05:06         rude │  >still no suspend/resume functionality
05:06         rude │  been a "TODO" since like 1998
05:06         shix │  i think openbsd has suspend/resume
05:06         rude │  yeah it does shix
05:06         rude │  openbsd and netbsd have their shit together
05:06         rude │  they arent trying really hard to "be" gnu/linux
05:06         rude │  freebsd userland is still largely gnu
05:10         BigE │  at least FBSD can be compiled with clang
05:10        Jayro │  .np

05:10        Jayro │  awh yeahhh
05:10         BigE │  linux is still dependent on gcc
05:11         shix │  and perl lol
05:11         BigE │  lol perl
05:11         rude │  BigE, freebsd compiled with clang performance
05:11         rude │  is shit
05:11         BigE │  lul
05:12         BigE │  well
05:12         BigE │  I suppose it will be better soon?
05:12         rude │  can they really do
05:12         rude │  what took gcc 20 years
05:12         rude │  in less than a 1/4 of the time?
05:12         BigE │  I think clang is the compiler that the ports tree uses now
05:13         BigE │  well, probably
05:13         BigE │  that is generally how technology works
05:13         rude │  the ports *can* be compiled with clang
05:13     NeoTerra │  FreeBSD is good for servers, that's about it
05:13         rude │  if u set that as the compiler to use
05:13         rude │  its not even "good"
05:13         rude │  linux has faster io
05:13         rude │  better socket scalability
05:13         BigE │  I think that clang is the default now though
05:13         rude │  better filesystems
05:13         rude │  nearly every element
05:13     NeoTerra │  FreeBSD jails are pretty awesome though
05:14         rude │  yeah
05:14         BigE │  there was a big hissy over it a while back
05:14         rude │  but things like kvm/openvz/xen etc
05:14     NeoTerra │  yeah rude I would always pick debian for a server
05:14         rude │  same
05:15         rude │  where is jooma
05:15         rude │  joomla
05:15         rude │  these days anyway
05:15         BigE │  depends what I want the server to do
05:15     NeoTerra │  we don't actually know, he hasn't been on in ages
05:15         shix │  rude: he died dude
05:15     NeoTerra │  we think he died or got arrested
05:15         shix │  I mean he did some pretty sketchy stuff
05:16      jjumbii │  he might have actually...
05:16        Jayro │  :'(
05:16         BigE │  that or he went on another cross country trip and his phone died or something
05:16      jjumbii │  Sammi was probably the only reason he didn't do as much heroin as he wanted
05:16         rude │  define sketchy shix
05:16     NeoTerra │  nah I think he got arrested. I checked the obits on his real name, and nothing came up
05:16      jjumbii │  well check arrest records then lol
05:16        tbuck │  rude: if heroin is involved there tends to be some sketch
05:17     NeoTerra │  jjumbii not a bad idea
05:17      jjumbii │  it's all public
05:17         shix │  BigE: lold
05:17         shix │  I know his first name lul
05:17         shix │  Not sure if its a common name in Alabama
05:18     NeoTerra │  jjumbii I keep forgetting you guys have public arrest records
05:18     NeoTerra │  and nothing came up
05:18      jjumbii │  murikaaaa
05:19      jjumbii │  someone find Amzo
05:19      jjumbii │  he could get ahold of SammiCat
05:19      jjumbii │  shix, what if sbe 
05:19      jjumbii │  she cheated on joom with amzo
05:19     NeoTerra │  she did not 
05:19     NeoTerra │  lol
05:19         shix │  lul
05:20         BigE │  but
05:20         BigE │  but
05:20         BigE │  what if she did
05:20         shix │  and Amzo killed her and now he's pretending to be her
05:20      jjumbii │  she could of gotten a flight over seas
05:20     NeoTerra │  plot twist: rude is amzo and is making sure joom doesn't come after him
05:21         part │  rude

05:22         BigE │  lul
05:22         shix │  lol
05:23         BigE │  so is the money on joom being dead then?
05:23         BigE │  or just on a heroin binge
05:23      jjumbii │  isnt it the same
05:24         shix │  Joom still owes me the heroin he promised
05:24        tbuck │  they kinda go hand in hand
05:26     NeoTerra │  I found joom

05:34         rude │  nah thats beyond him

05:38         BigE │  can someone explain that too me?
05:38         shix │  yeah, people use shake n bake to go on the road cooking meth in a gatorade bottle

06:09     NeoTerra │  shtr0m we don't kick idlers
06:09     NeoTerra │  not to worry :)
06:10       shtr0m │  nice

06:11       shtr0m │  freedom!!!!!
06:12     NeoTerra │  uofm is uni?
06:12       shtr0m │  yea of manitoba
06:14       shtr0m │  they paid waterloo to come up with a program for them
06:14       shtr0m │  XD
06:15       shtr0m │  there are some good profs there but some are kinda.... sucky

06:16         BigE │  lulz
06:16       shtr0m │  there are a lot of foreign students
06:17         BigE │  that is par for the course in Canada
06:17       shtr0m │  University of Manitoba has approximately 28 000 students
06:18       shtr0m │  I googled it because I was curious too.
06:18       shtr0m │  learning on your own is way more fun.
06:18     NeoTerra │  BigE shtr0m did you guys ever have to take a digital logic/circuits course?
06:19         BigE │  sort of
06:19       shtr0m │  there was one
06:19         BigE │  it is a first year class
06:19         BigE │  but an elective
06:19         BigE │  I didnt take it
06:19       shtr0m │  we never did any hands on stuff.
06:19     NeoTerra │  I am doing one this semester
06:19     NeoTerra │  hands on and all
06:20       shtr0m │  cool
06:20         BigE │  I did lots of that in high school though
06:20         BigE │  so I wasnt let down or anything
06:20       shtr0m │  I was let down when they cancel the real time systems course...
06:20       shtr0m │  took parallel programming instead
06:20       shtr0m │  which was next to no work... didn't learn anything
06:21         BigE │  yeah, I am taking that right now
06:21         BigE │  lul
06:21       shtr0m │  pretty sad for a 4th year course
06:21         BigE │  our class is like OpenMP, CUDA, MIP
06:21         BigE │  MPI*
06:21       shtr0m │  are you doing OpenMP, or MPI? cuda?
06:21       shtr0m │  haha yea
06:21     NeoTerra │  BigE do you know anything about logic gates?
06:21         BigE │  and a bit of posix threads
06:21       shtr0m │  BigE: which Uni?
06:21         BigE │  NeoTerra: you mean transistors?
06:21         BigE │  shtr0m: UBC
06:21       shtr0m │  nice
06:21     NeoTerra │  BigE yes, I suppose
06:22         BigE │  NeoTerra: it all depends on how they teach it I guess
06:22       shtr0m │  UBC have a supercomputer?
06:22         BigE │  they could go the computer science route, of teaching you it all on paper, making you do truth tables and shit
06:22         BigE │  or the other route of having you actually do the breadboarding for it
06:22     NeoTerra │  BigE does an AND gate go true if both inputs are the same
06:22     NeoTerra │  haha we do both
06:22     NeoTerra │  labs with practical and theoretical aspects
06:22       shtr0m │  NeoTerra: if both are 1
06:22         BigE │  if THIS AND THIS
06:23         BigE │  TRUE
06:23       shtr0m │  if 1 and 1
06:23       shtr0m │  then 1
06:23         BigE │  which gate is the one that you can use to make any possible combination of gates?
06:23         BigE │  is it an AND gate with a NOT?
06:23         BigE │  or is it an OR gate
06:24         rude │  if (!i && 1 % 1 == 0) i ? (x = 0) : (y = -1));
06:24       shtr0m │  drep i can't remember I would have to look that one up in my notes
06:24         rude │  its OR
06:24         rude │  BigE
06:24         rude │  right
06:24         BigE │  okay
06:24         BigE │  that is what I thought
06:24     NeoTerra │  the question is worded, design a circuit so that if inputs x and y are the same, the circuit is true, when they are different, it's false
06:24       shtr0m │  so it is OR
06:25         BigE │  that is basically the definition of an AND gate
06:25         BigE │  lul
06:25       shtr0m │  lol
06:25       shtr0m │  yea I am thinking about it right now
06:25         rude │  everything boils down to logic gates
06:25         rude │  on a circuit 
06:25     NeoTerra │  BigE I thought so too, but the "same" input is throwing me off
06:25         rude │  at the end of the day
06:25         BigE │  such logic
06:25         BigE │  many gate
06:25       shtr0m │  lol!
06:25         BigE │  wow
06:26         rude │  doge used to be funny-ish back in 06-09
06:26         rude │  before the cancerous majority got their hands on it
06:26         rude │  and bastardized the meme interely
06:27     NeoTerra │  I take it same means anything that isn't 0?
06:27     NeoTerra │  or are there only 1 and 0 values
06:28         rude │  in logic gates
06:28         rude │  its bas2
06:28         rude │  base 2
06:28     NeoTerra │  yeah that's what I thought
06:28     NeoTerra │  weirdly worded question
06:29     NeoTerra │  because we also talked about voltages and gates
06:29     NeoTerra │  but w/e
06:29         BigE │  well
06:29         BigE │  voltages are how it is represented on a physical chip
06:30         BigE │  high and low voltage essentially
06:31     NeoTerra │  right
06:31     NeoTerra │  so wait
06:31     NeoTerra │  for that question I posed
06:31     NeoTerra │  that means that if x and y are both low voltage, it should be true
06:31     NeoTerra │  correct?
06:31         BigE │  depends
06:31         BigE │  are we talking about actual logic gates?
06:31         BigE │  causde the low voltage would be 0's
06:31     NeoTerra │  right
06:32         BigE │  and two 0's doesnt make a true
06:32        Jayro │  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4KPWOUkbw8
06:32     NeoTerra │  it does if you have a NOR gate
06:32        Jayro │  lullll
06:32         BigE │  with an AND gate at least
06:32         BigE │  yeah
06:32         BigE │  a NOR will do that
06:32     NeoTerra │  so basically this is a NOR gate and an AND gate feeding into one OR gate
06:32     NeoTerra │  got it
06:32       shtr0m │  NeoTerra: write a C program and try out all possibilities
06:32         BigE │  lol
06:32       shtr0m │  ^ & | bitwise operations
06:33       shtr0m │  or flash cards
06:33     NeoTerra │  yeah I'm doing this in python lul
06:33       shtr0m │  also a good language
06:34       shtr0m │  NeoTerra: are you aware of an XOR?
06:35     NeoTerra │  yes
06:35       shtr0m │  those are my favorite
06:35       shtr0m │  :)
06:35         BigE │  shtr0m: get out of hear with your XOR cipher
06:35         BigE │  here*
06:36         rude │  str[i] ^= 1337;
06:36       shtr0m │  you XOR everythin with 1337?
06:36       shtr0m │  haha nice
06:37       shtr0m │  my favorite is the one time pad
06:37         rude │  i prefer calculating the md5 hash of each individual byte
06:37         join │  SammiCat
06:37         rude │  than calculating the crc32 hash of that md5 string
06:37         rude │  and the xoring the individual byte by that
06:37         rude │  only takes 5 minutes to encrypt a 10 byte message
06:38         BigE │  shtr0m: xor a message with a key larger than the message and it is impossible to crack
06:38         BigE │  right?
06:38       shtr0m │  just XOR it again
06:38         rude │  my fav encryption to fuck with people
06:38       shtr0m │  involutary key
06:38         rude │  is create a buffer 2x the size of the original bytes
06:38         rude │  and each 2nd byte
06:38         rude │  fill it with a random value
06:39         rude │  totally irrelveant to the payload
06:39         BigE │  shtr0m: the whole point of the one time pad is that you can destroy the key after you encode the message though
06:39       shtr0m │  we should have crypto wednesdays were everyone comes up with some ciphertext and everyone has to try and decrypt it!
06:39         BigE │  shtr0m: that would be cool
06:39       shtr0m │  BigE: yea. you can't use the same key twice
06:39       shtr0m │  (rather you shouldn't)
06:39         BigE │  shtr0m: I wouldnt have the time though
06:39       shtr0m │  I have a whole but load
06:40       shtr0m │  variations of common ciphers
06:40       shtr0m │  best course was crypto by far
06:40       shtr0m │  that I took
06:40         BigE │  they only offer crypto every like 3 or 4 years here
06:40         BigE │  I think it will be offered next year
06:41       shtr0m │  that's a MUST!
06:41         BigE │  yeah
06:41         BigE │  it is taught under MATH though
06:41       shtr0m │  yea. there is a lot of math in it
06:41         BigE │  so I hope it doesnt have some bull shit pre-reqs that I dont have
06:41       shtr0m │  it shouldn't
06:41         BigE │  It might.
06:41         BigE │  lul
06:41       shtr0m │  haha
06:42       shtr0m │  do you have the ROASS for it handy?
06:42         BigE │  nope
06:42         BigE │  lul
06:42       shtr0m │  for our course all you needed to know was Bayes theorm.... a handful of proofs... euclidean algo
06:43       shtr0m │  wasn't that bad. it was an even amount of math and programming
06:43       shtr0m │  oh and some euler phi stuff
06:44       shtr0m │  the cs students did a lot better than the math students
06:45         BigE │  I dont think I have taken a class with any of that in it
06:45         BigE │  lul
06:46         BigE │  most of that is abstract algebra fun
06:48       shtr0m │  I'll post one on the forum

17:19    Ippytraxx │  k, well if you need something more powerful and with way more I/O pins, check out the teensy
17:32         rude │  http://i.imgur.com/TTtmFf0.jpg
17:38        Jayro │  Ippytraxx, if I need more pins I just planned on using a shift register
17:38        Jayro │  but ill check it out
17:42    Ippytraxx │  yeah but they are a pain
17:42    Ippytraxx │  unless you need like 100s of pins
17:42    Ippytraxx │  but i mean the uno has 12 pins
17:43    Ippytraxx │  and teensy 3.1 has 34
17:43    Ippytraxx │  plus it's waay smaller, so easier to stash
17:43        Jayro │  nice
17:43        Jayro │  for my project 12 pins should be more than enough.
17:44        Jayro │  but the teensy looks nice

04:05         rude │  lf94, thats the suggest C/C++ programming style by microsoft
04:05         rude │  whats so bad about it?
04:06         lf94 │  1) it's just fucking horrible to read
04:06         lf94 │  no one reads up to down, only the chinese do that
04:06     NeoTerra │  wut
04:06     NeoTerra │  lf94 it looks fine
04:06         lf94 │  2) it's by microsoft
04:07         lf94 │  what's not bad about it
04:07         shix │  NeoTerra: there are different c indent styles
04:07         lf94 │  3) this is C# not C/C++
04:07         shix │  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style 
04:07         lf94 │  rude: infinite loop that writes a registry key?
04:07         shix │  there are just better ways to do it
04:08         lf94 │  seems pointless
04:08         lf94 │  why are you writing pointless software for a pointless operating system
04:08     NeoTerra │  it isn't pointless, lot's of people use it
04:08     NeoTerra │  lul
04:08         lf94 │  pointless people, that is
04:08         lf94 │  B)

04:11     NeoTerra │  lul
04:11         rude │  lf94, see the for (;;) in the registry loop
04:12         rude │  its going to become a WaitForSingleObject(hEvent, 5000) != WAIT_OBJECT_0
04:12         rude │  and there is no better way to ensure registry startup lf94
04:12         rude │  unless you want to wait for registry events
04:12         rude │  which can be bypassed by and random software, and delete your key right under your nose
04:14         lf94 │  NeoTerra, banned?
04:14         lf94 │  I was never banned
04:14         lf94 │  rude: nothing impressive over here
04:15         lf94 │  just ubuntu+xchat
04:15         rude │  noticed
04:15         rude │  was half expecting some obscure hard-to-use distro/os
04:15         lf94 │  rude are you trying to code some crappy virus
04:15         rude │  lf94, yeah
04:15         rude │  and its not crappy
04:15         lf94 │  thought so
04:15         lf94 │  yes it is
04:15         rude │  why so?
04:15         rude │  i posted 2 funcs
04:15         rude │  that function perfectly
04:16         lf94 │  because it only works on windows binary format compatible kernels
04:16         rude │  :|
04:16         lf94 │  but that is only 1 reason
04:16         rude │  whats the others
04:16         lf94 │  why do you suddenly care
04:16         lf94 │  it means nothing
04:16         rude │  if you spot any flaws/errors
04:16         rude │  i'm always open, improving software
04:16         rude │  is never a bad thing
04:17         lf94 │  that's what everyone says but no one actually ever improves anything
04:17         lf94 │  another reason is because you are targeting  a windows specific component
04:17         rude │  no shit
04:17         quit │  mxtm
04:17         lf94 │  so fundamentally, this is shit
04:17         rude │  no profit in writing a banking bot for *nix platforms
04:18         rude │  the only people using those platforms are autists and poor people
04:19         lf94 │  But you're not doing that
04:19         rude │  i am...?
04:19         rude │  already have webinjects somewhat finished
04:19         lf94 │  <lf94> rude are you trying to code some crappy virus
04:19         lf94 │  <rude> lf94, yeah
04:19         rude │  just adding up support for external images
04:20         lf94 │  webinjects?
04:20         rude │  intercepting browsers
04:20         lf94 │  making up terms now I see
04:20         rude │  when they download a web page
04:20         rude │  then changing the content on the page
04:20         lf94 │  man in the middle attack you mean
04:20         rude │  so the users sees something different to what the website intended
04:20         rude │  yeah
04:20         rude │  so i can add a few extra fields
04:20         rude │  to a form
04:21         rude │  so trick the user into entering more details about their card/bank
04:21         rude │  when logging onto onling banking services
04:21         lf94 │  could you intercept my browser?
04:22         rude │  what browser are you using?
04:22         lf94 │  lynx
04:22         lf94 │  sometimes mothra
04:22         lf94 │  and abaco
04:22         rude │  as long as they are linked to use (g)libc
04:22         rude │  and use openssl or some other ssl lib
04:22         rude │  then yes
04:22         lf94 │  cool
04:22         lf94 │  so I'm guessing I have to visit some malicious looking url
04:23         rude │  no
04:23         rude │  once you are initially infected
04:23         rude │  the user wont be able to tell, unless they look really hard
04:23         lf94 │  oh I see
04:23         rude │  but obv the element of stealth
04:23         rude │  isnt exactly the same on *nix
04:23         rude │  but still very possible to intercept the system call stubs
04:23         rude │  in the c libraries
04:24         rude │  in regards to file/process/directory enumeration
04:24         rude │  and just remove my broker process from the list
04:24         lf94 │  so you infect someone first (somehow), then, the virus just changes html content to add some fields
04:24         lf94 │  after X happens, send data to C&C server
04:24         rude │  yeah
04:24         rude │  only if webinjects for the given site are enabled
04:25         lf94 │  well have fun
04:25         rude │  otherwise it just grabs https post data
04:25         rude │  and the typical route of infected
04:25         lf94 │  sounds like a waste of time and unoriginal
04:25         rude │  infection*
04:25         rude │  is via browser based exploits
04:25         rude │  flash and java are the main contenders in the shitty vulnerable software field
04:26     NeoTerra │  rude don't forget abode pdf plugins
04:26         rude │  yeah
04:26         rude │  the favourite of the email spammers
04:26         rude │  the retards who open random pdfs
04:26         rude │  they got in an email from someone/something they dont know
04:26         rude │  have only themselves to blame
04:28     NeoTerra │  yup
04:29     NeoTerra │  it's called natural selection

04:46     NeoTerra │  doing some calc homework
04:46         BigE │  ha
04:47         BigE │  which calculus?
04:47     NeoTerra │  I
04:47         BigE │  TOP LOL
04:47     NeoTerra │  yeah I know -.-
04:47         BigE │  such noob
04:47     NeoTerra │  well they only make us take I and II for CS
04:47     NeoTerra │  and I dropped it last term because I fucked up the midterm
04:48         BigE │  I dont know how UoT does things, but I have classes right now for my degree that would probably be painful without Calc III
04:48         BigE │  and I will probably do calc 4 next year
04:48         BigE │  calculus is easy credits, I just didnt want the prof who is teaching this term
04:49     NeoTerra │  BigE well calc I for us probably I and II for you guys
04:49     NeoTerra │  because they lump a ton of stuff into ours
04:49         BigE │  do you do integrals?
04:49         BigE │  you shouldnt
04:49     NeoTerra │  we do
04:49     NeoTerra │  lul
04:49         BigE │  the fuck
04:49     NeoTerra │  first year calc is derivatives, integrals, and a bunch of other shit
04:49     NeoTerra │  second year is more theoretical
04:49     NeoTerra │  but also optional for CS
04:49         BigE │  Ah, I see
04:50     NeoTerra │  unless you do the scientific graphical design CS specialisation, in which case you need it, as well as linear algebra
04:52         BigE │  meh, more calculus cant hurt
04:52         BigE │  and I need upper level science credits to graduate
04:53     NeoTerra │  also the prof I have for my proofs class is reusing old problem sets from 2008. sadly he does not know that I archived and wget'd all the old course websites before they took them down
04:53     NeoTerra │  muahaha
04:53         BigE │  so calculus and linear algebra make the most sense anyways
04:53         BigE │  if only I could do abstract algebra...
04:53         BigE │  oh well
04:53         BigE │  I dont feel like taking more proofs classes
04:54     NeoTerra │  there's a first year calc course here that's all theoretical calculus proofs
04:54     NeoTerra │  and is pure death
04:54     NeoTerra │  lul
04:54         BigE │  ha
04:55         rude │  BigE, have you mastered matrices yet?
04:55     NeoTerra │  rude I did matrices in high school
04:55         BigE │  I also did linear programming
04:55         BigE │  so yes
04:55         BigE │  such matrix
04:55     NeoTerra │  like gaussian elimination and all that

04:55         BigE │  woooo
04:56         rude │  in my first year of cs
04:56         rude │  i was a total autist
04:56         rude │  i handed in programming assignments in C
04:56         rude │  and tried to argue with the lecturer
04:56         rude │  that java is retarded
04:56         rude │  and is destined to die
04:56         BigE │  we *had* to do them in Java
04:56         rude │  ^
04:56         BigE │  Java wont die
04:56         rude │  java is a cancer
04:56         BigE │  Java is more portable than C, it will last
04:57         rude │  compiling for 2/3 platforms
04:57         rude │  aint hard though
04:57         rude │  java breeds useless code monkeys
04:57     NeoTerra │  lul

04:58     NeoTerra │  the prof is fighting people to make them use an editor + terminal for coding
04:58     NeoTerra │  instead of an IDE
04:59         BigE │  LOL
04:59         rude │  haskell = hipsters
04:59         BigE │  good luck with that

04:59         shix │  mfw need an IDE to compile C code

05:19         rude │  NeoTerra, nginx is still pretty terrible for serving dynamic content on the large scale
05:20         rude │  nginx + php module
05:20         rude │  is a oxymoron
05:20     NeoTerra │  this is true
05:20     NeoTerra │  U of T has little dynamic content
05:20     NeoTerra │  it's mostly plain HTML for lecture websites

05:26         lf94 │  then sam -d B)
05:26         rude │  BigE, its only because http requests/response

05:27         lf94 │  it makes sense
05:27         lf94 │  if I file is 10000000 lines long
05:27         lf94 │  you're going to do the following:
05:27         lf94 │   /search_for_my_function/

05:27         lf94 │   /find_main_function.*}/p
05:28         lf94 │  which prints the main function
05:28         lf94 │  then start doing /search_for_function.*})
05:28         shix │  except most of the time I don't open files with that many lines
05:28         lf94 │  to find relevant functions
05:28         lf94 │  shix: it makes sense though
05:28         lf94 │  because you are not looking at shit you don't need to see
05:29         lf94 │  I can see why people liked ed
05:29         lf94 │  think about when you program shix
05:29         lf94 │  do you look at 3 functions at once?
05:30         shix │  no

07:25      bottomy │  yeh everything that returns a scalar follows that ^
07:27      bottomy │  cause sometimes it's more optimal or you get that extra processing for free (depending on the instructions available) but sometimes you don't so have to give options based on how you may possibly use it lol
07:39      bottomy │  lol it's going to end up like 3k LOC just for a simple vec math lib, which is pretty ridiculous haha

07:46      bottomy │  well it will be the last time (I swear), I used to make a new one for each project I'd start. it got pretty bad so just making one that's optimized for all platforms I target and will just now use that across the board.
07:47         BigE │  i know a grad student that did that for his graphical modelling library
07:47         BigE │  got tired ow using things like maple, or writing his own for each project
07:47         BigE │  so he just wrote his own
07:48      bottomy │  :)
07:52      bottomy │  it's what I've been trying to do quite a bit recently. just get everything that I often use in one single codebase, it just saves future work, plus gives me more incentive to polish that single codebase and makes it so much simpler when switching between different projects (I'm even guilty of using different naming conventions in some of my older things lol, one project had it's vec math like vadd, vmul, etc., another has it as

14:28       phyrne │  You didn't put it too well (no offense) haha
14:28        venam │  don't you put your automation device in the middle of the circuit?
14:28       phyrne │  Not always
14:29       phyrne │  If you're talking purely about turning things on and off (or dimming lights), then yeah, it can be done that way
14:29        venam │  so how do you control where the electricity goes?
14:30       phyrne │  venam: You're talking about enabling automation on standard electrical devices which are unaware of any networking. So, of course, you have to add a controller in the middle
14:30         yrmt │  phyrne: oh yeah, you told me to use cron to push my blog to github before
14:30        venam │  ah, you are talking about devices that have I/O

14:35      bottomy │  microcontrollers usually have a lot of pins so you should be fine, either just extend with some shift registers or something
14:35         yrmt │  yep
14:35         yrmt │  but that's messy
14:35         yrmt │  we don't want phyrne's room to look like a gentoo dev's lair
14:35      bottomy │  stick it in the wall?
14:35       phyrne │  yrmt: lul
14:35         join │  akacase
14:35      bottomy │  or do we xD
14:35       phyrne │  NO WE DON'T
14:35       phyrne │  haha
14:35        venam │  phyrne: I've seen coffee machines with a RESful API
14:36        venam │  *RESTful
14:36         yrmt │  what has the world come to
14:36       phyrne │  venam: Yeah! :p
14:36      bottomy │  lol
14:36       phyrne │  yrmt: inorite

14:36       phyrne │  I'll tell you one of the features I'm most excited about implementing in my project
14:36         yrmt │  I fucking hate when I see downloads for software like : x86-Darwin - i386-FreeBSD - amd64-Fedora
14:36         yrmt │  and Ubuntu, and OpenSUSE
14:37         yrmt │  these distros act like they're full operating systems
14:38       phyrne │  So, I get up very early for work, and, waking up with the light turning on and the radio/music/a tv show is all very well and good when I'm on my own. But, when my girlfirend is round, I don't want all that shit going on in the morning. So, I'm going to use a scheduled broadcast, with arp, to check if her phone is on the network, then if it is, store a boolean variable to determine the behaviour of the wake up sequence the next morning ;D
14:38       phyrne │  I hope people will like that feature, I know I'll find it useful!
14:39         yrmt │  :)

14:40        venam │  phyrne: that's very cool
14:41       phyrne │  venam: Thanks man :) Should be a fun project
14:41         yrmt │  and yeah python's nice for that
14:41       phyrne │  Certainly a great opportunity to learn a proper language
14:41         yrmt │  Perfect even
14:41        venam │  the normal automation should be easy but this part might be tricky
14:41       phyrne │  yrmt: :D
14:41      bottomy │  pssh, use heat sensors on the bed to check that there's 2 bodies in there. then set up eye tracking cameras and turn the music up but if her eyes start moving soften it, and adjust frequency to range she can't hear but you can. failing that, just electrocute yourself :P
14:41       phyrne │  venam: Should be reletively simple I think :)
14:41         yrmt │  hehe, or do it the bottomy way
14:42       phyrne │  bottomy: haha
14:42         yrmt │  Make it activate some smooth music if the room's temp get high
14:42       phyrne │  yrmt: lul
14:42       phyrne │  dim the lights
14:42         yrmt │  hehe
14:42         yrmt │  Austin Powers rotating bed would be a plus
14:42      akacase │  I think weight sensors would be better.
14:43       phyrne │  yrmt: bwahah
14:43      akacase │  and just test if the collected weight is over, say, 400 pounds.
14:43       phyrne │  akacase: Not sure if kidding....
