17:15       zero57 │  hey Neuromatic do you what the rule_command is to stop moving into the desktop that my application is in? I autostart steam via bspwmrc, and when it finishes loading, bspwm focuses into the workspace that steam is in
17:16       zero57 │  the rule I set for Steam is "class == "Steam" => floating = on desktop = ^9"
17:16       zero57 │  I tried follow = off and focus = off, but it still doesn't work
17:16       zero57 │  Before the change to rulc/ruld, and when I was using bspc rule -a command, it worked fine with just floating on and the desktop rule.
17:19   Neuromatic │  then update bspwm and use internal rules
17:20   Neuromatic │  Is the steam client named 'Steam' in window class?
17:22       zero57 │  Neuromatic: yeah
17:22   Neuromatic │  Can I see you bspwmrc, or rules file for case that you excluded them?
17:23       zero57 │  http://ix.io/9y7 bspwmrc
17:23       zero57 │  http://ix.io/9y8 bspwm_rules
17:25   Neuromatic │  seems to be okay
17:26   Neuromatic │  did you tryed to set a comma between floating and desktop detting?
17:26   Neuromatic │  setting
17:26       zero57 │  no, i'll try now
17:27   Neuromatic │  else you still can update and use internal rules
17:27       zero57 │  oh, i thought the internal rules was removed?
17:28       zero57 │  I have bspwm (non-git) 0.8.7-1 installed and when I updated, the bspc rule command was gone
17:29       zero57 │  anyways, it's fine if I can't fix it, just a small little hassle every time I log in
17:29         quit │  zero57
17:30         join │  zero57
17:31       zero57 │  yeah, doesn't work
17:31   Neuromatic │  internal rules are back by actual git version
17:32   Neuromatic │  So you can use ex- and internal rules now
17:32       zero57 │  I see, thanks! I think I'll switch back then :)
17:33   Neuromatic │  alright
17:33   Neuromatic │  Plase follow the development on github in the future. So you are always be informated
17:34       zero57 │  Will do.
17:38         quit │  zero57
19:16        tbuck │  I've got my external monitor hooked up but its mirroring my laptop screen and the resolution is wrong
19:16        tbuck │  fun fun. and of course theres little documentation
19:21        tbuck │  do i just have to do some xrandr magic? kinda stuck here
19:27   Neuromatic │  There was a guy here a few weeks ago. He made a xrandr patch for multimonitor setups.
19:27   Neuromatic │  I#ll try to find his stuff
19:27        tbuck │  that would be great
19:28   Neuromatic │  You're on sluck?
19:28        tbuck │  slackware? yeah
19:29   Neuromatic │  Here is his slackbuild with multimonitor patch:
19:29   Neuromatic │  http://tinyurl.com/mfol4vv
19:29        tbuck │  oh nice, a slackbuild :)
19:29        tbuck │  thanks ill look into that
19:30   Neuromatic │  np
19:32        tbuck │  i had always thought it had support already tho huh
19:33   Neuromatic │  yea w/ xinemera. But xrandr does its job better w/ bspwm
19:49        tbuck │  ok im starting to make some progress after getting familiar with xrandr.
19:53   Neuromatic │  Do that
22:12         join │  ravenx
22:13       ravenx │  is it possible to make the terminal open up as floating only in desktop ^2?
22:13       ravenx │  in a certain size as well?
22:14   Neuromatic │  If I'm right, then 'per-desktop-rules' are not implemented yet…
22:14       ravenx │  aww
22:14   Neuromatic │  Maybe you can create a lil sh script?
22:14       ravenx │  i guess i could look into that.
22:14       ravenx │  does bloom/baskerville ever come on here?
22:14   Neuromatic │  No :D
22:15        tbuck │  ive never seen him. earsplit started this chan and i dont even see him here anymore
22:15   Neuromatic │  cuz heres less activity
22:15       ravenx │  haha
22:16       ravenx │  i\ think most of hte stuff goes through unixhub first then on to here.
22:20   Neuromatic │  maybe… You may want to ask baskerville on github/issues-section for the per-desktop-rules. perhaps the internal rule-command can do such stuff?
22:21       ravenx │  that sounds like a good idea
22:21       ravenx │  i'll do just that.
22:21       ravenx │  or perhaps the arch forum's bspwm thread.
22:22   Neuromatic │  yea, maybe this way is faster
22:32        tbuck │  i wish there was per desktop padding / other settings too :/
22:34   Neuromatic │  tbuck: Yes per desktop padding would be awesome

23:03  irc-5225225 │  Is there a ppa for bspwm on ubuntu, or should I attempt to build from source?
23:04   Neuromatic │  Nobody is using ubuntu here. Use the git version
23:04   Neuromatic │  If you have problems with it, we can spend you better help
23:07  irc-5225225 │  Neuromatic: Well, mint, but close enough. I'll try to compile the git version.,
23:08       ravenx │  use checkinstall
23:08       ravenx │  for painless removing if it doesn't work.
23:08       ravenx │  i tried bspwm on my linux mint desktop and i haven't had luck.  let me know if you do.
23:09       ravenx │  Neuromatic: are you using a login manager?
23:09   Neuromatic │  ravenx: no
23:09       ravenx │  so just the tty text on arch boot?
23:10   Neuromatic │  Yea, but i've got a nice /etc/issue :P
23:12       ravenx │  what's that?
23:13   Neuromatic │  /etc/issue is a file that will be displayed over the login prompt.
23:13       ravenx │  ooh
23:14       ravenx │  how did you "decorate" yours?
23:14        tbuck │  TIL. learned a lot today actually
23:14       ravenx │  i learned that you can customize that prompt jus tnow.
23:14       ravenx │  what is the \r and the (\l) though?
23:15   Neuromatic │  \r is kernel and \l … I#ve fogotten :P
23:15   Neuromatic │  http://paste.unixhub.net/index.php/4MnI/bash

23:15       ravenx │  NEIN.
23:15       ravenx │  j/k.
23:16   Neuromatic │  No, its a colored "Archlinux" and some information
23:16       ravenx │  sweet.
23:16       ravenx │  gonna give it a try after my volume bar
23:16       ravenx │  another 5 mins
23:16       ravenx │  then i re login.
23:17   Neuromatic │  nice
23:25       ravenx │  okay so how do i copy that in to ensure the spacing doesn't get fucked?
23:25       ravenx │  just vim, insert, middle mouse button?
23:26   Neuromatic │  In those cases I use xclip
23:26       ravenx │  how do i xclip?
23:26       ravenx │  :(
23:27   Neuromatic │  install xclip -> mark the text from paste.unixhub and do xclip -o > file
23:28       ravenx │  ah i see
23:29       ravenx │  it says "zsh permission denied: issue
23:29        tbuck │  ravenx: i have a vim command: set pastetoggle=<F2>
23:29   Neuromatic │  do it in your home dir an then mv it to /etc
23:29       ravenx │  LOL i just remembered i had in my vimrc
23:30        tbuck │  i just hit f2 in insert mode, hold shift and middle click and things will get pasted in without the indentation
23:30        tbuck │  although that might not be what you need in this situation
23:31       ravenx │  i think i got it
23:31       ravenx │  will reboot to see
23:31         quit │  ravenx
23:31   Neuromatic │  lol

00:28     tstrokes │  no errors

00:29   Neuromatic │  bar is installed?

00:33   Neuromatic │  see his git
00:33     tstrokes │  yep both installed
00:33   Neuromatic │  Then you did somthing wrong
00:33   Neuromatic │  permissions of panels fifo?
00:34   Neuromatic │  panel and panel_bar are executable?
00:34   Neuromatic │  the scripts are downloaded in raw?
00:34     tstrokes │  yep cloned from github and executable
00:35   Neuromatic │  check you panel_fifo for perms and make sure that the correct vars are set in /etc/profile
00:35    dizzydave │  make sure they're all looking in the right places
00:36    dizzydave │  did you get them from earsplit's git or from baskerville?
00:37     tstrokes │  baskerville
00:37     tstrokes │  what should the permissions be on panel-fifo
00:37    dizzydave │  hmm that one was pretty straightforward iirc
00:38   Neuromatic │  prw-r--r--
00:38     tstrokes │  yep
00:39   Neuromatic │  your panel_fifo has the corrent name in panel and panel_bar?
00:39    dizzydave │  did you try running the script from a shell?
00:39    dizzydave │  or does it not work even then?

19:44   Neuromatic │  What did you mean w/ 'blank window'?
19:44    dizzydave │  pretty much just an empty space that I can manipulate like an ordinary branch
19:45   Neuromatic │  This feature is not longer available in bspwm

20:26        tbuck │  Neuromatic: there arent frames in bspwm anymore?
20:26        tbuck │  damn... im still on version 0.8.6 and if thats the case im just noever going to update
20:26         part │  Mechanimal
20:26        tbuck │  keeps removing/changin shit
20:26   Neuromatic │  tbuck: The `frames` are replaced by pseudotiling
20:27        tbuck │  ok so changed not removed
20:27        tbuck │  still... he needs to figure his shit out. too many small changes
20:28   Neuromatic │  I think he was doing that cuz earsplit wanted him to do it
20:29        tbuck │  ah. i need to follow development better. ive been out of the loop lately
20:30   Neuromatic │  But if I remember correclty, the psuedotiling was scheluled and this `frame` stuff was only a test run…
20:30   Neuromatic │  lol, I thought fraun_ has trouble with bspwm; why he did not join #bspwm?
20:31        tbuck │  yeah ive been waiting for him lol
20:31        tbuck │  id rather help people here than spam unixhub with bspwm stuff

22:01       phill_ │  i crunchbang is using slim as its default login manager
22:02   Neuromatic │  Ah I see; this problem is already known
22:02       phill_ │  yep
22:02   Neuromatic │  Did you followd the guide on the arch wiki?
22:02       phill_ │  i folowed the tutorion on bspwm's git page
22:02   Neuromatic │  Can I see your .xinitrc
22:02   Neuromatic │  ?
22:03       phill_ │  how can i acces it?
22:03       phill_ │  sorry im new to linux
22:04   Neuromatic │  Oh, then please dont use bspwm. It is under high development and only for advanved users at this moment.
22:04   Neuromatic │  There is no stable version. you will ever have trouble with it
22:04       phill_ │  then which tiling wm should i install?
22:05   Neuromatic │  There are many. You choosed bspwm so I think i3 or herbstluftwm can be your taste

00:42   dansbandit │  yeah i've got it to work dotpyfe
00:42   dansbandit │  have you tried running xrandr to check that you are using the right monitors?
00:42      dotpyfe │  yup
00:42      dotpyfe │  i have LVDS-0 and VGA-0
00:42      dotpyfe │  but maybe im not using xrandr correctly?
00:43      dotpyfe │  display is on lvds-0 by default
00:43      dotpyfe │  in .xinitrc i do 'xrandr --output vga-0 --options...'
00:48   dansbandit │  you need to mess with that I think
00:48      dotpyfe │  oh yeah?
00:48   dansbandit │  I'm using AMD's non-free driver and setting it up with amdcccle
00:49   dansbandit │  unfortunately the "wrong" monitor has the panel but it should work!
00:50      dotpyfe │  well that sounds similar to my issue
00:50      dotpyfe │  like
00:50      dotpyfe │  if i start desktops I - w/e on lvds-0, which is the 'main' display
00:50      dotpyfe │  it has crazy behavior
00:51      dotpyfe │  but if i start them on vga-0, the external
00:51      dotpyfe │  it works correctly
00:51   dansbandit │  my only problem is that the panel is on the wrong monitor
00:51   dansbandit │  but the right monitor has the right tags for me
00:51      dotpyfe │  my panel stretches across both
00:51      dotpyfe │  haha
00:52   dansbandit │  I had that problem before
00:52   dansbandit │  you need to make with XINERAMA=1
00:53      dotpyfe │  hm, interesting

17:40       Mapley │  Since that's what I'm encountering at the moment.
17:40  tuftedocelo │  Is it in your PATH and marked executable?
17:40       Mapley │  yes.
17:40       Mapley │  Sometimes it starts, sometimes it doesn't.
17:41       Mapley │  No errors when starting up, and all the fonts are fine.
17:42   Neuromatic │  Maybe the bar is already running. Try pkill bar and restart bar via term
17:42       Mapley │  Neuromatic: that's what I've been doing ^^
17:42       Mapley │  Apparently it /is/ already running but it isn't visible.
17:44   Neuromatic │  Then kill bar restart X and start bar manuelly.

03:24       egroeg │  tried it.  that's the normal pointer.  too mainstream :)
03:24       egroeg │  i want to go back to the default x one
03:25  tuftedocelo │  Wait, like the big black X?
03:25       egroeg │  yeah
03:25  tuftedocelo │  Oh, no idea in that case. Sorry :(
03:25       ravenx │  hi guys
03:25       egroeg │  cool.  thanks though
03:25       ravenx │  is there a way of making a terminal with the command "cal 3"
03:25       ravenx │  start up everytime i log in?
03:25       ravenx │  but the catch is that i want the terminal a certain size in a certain position?

04:56        tbuck │  ravenx: should be possible
04:56       ravenx │  is it something you have done?
04:56       ravenx │  if so, can you i see your configs?
04:56        tbuck │  you should be able to do something with the arguments passed to your term when you open it
04:56        tbuck │  like urxvt -c 'cal 3' or something like that
04:58       ravenx │  right
04:58       ravenx │  but in terms of having it positioned in a certain space on my desktop?
04:58        tbuck │  there should be args for that too
04:59       ravenx │  kk
04:59       ravenx │  so it is possible
04:59       ravenx │  i juts didn't wanna first crawl through a man page looking for something that isn't there.
04:59        tbuck │  yeah sounds like it
04:59        tbuck │  theres stuff like that for rxvt at least
04:59  angelic_sed │  ravenx: what's the point of having it positioned in a certain place? is there something else you're trying to do?
05:00       ravenx │  yes, because when i start up my computer, i want the calcurse application to always be at the bottom left as i always refer to it and add to it
05:00       ravenx │  and on desktop 1, where calcurse is always staying, i only ever need two more terminals, making it a total of three.
05:01        tbuck │  yeah the size and positioning wouldnt work unless it was floating of course
05:01  tuftedocelo │  Possibly the private window state in bspwm?
05:01  tuftedocelo │  I'm not sure how it's used in practice
05:02  tuftedocelo │  https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm#window-states
05:03  angelic_sed │  I don't understand why it's called private
05:03       ravenx │  ooh
05:03       ravenx │  private eh?
05:03       ravenx │  is tha tsomething that's new?
05:03       ravenx │  o_O
05:04        tbuck │  not really
05:04       ravenx │  any of you guys use private?
05:04        tbuck │  it kinda locks the window in place and tiles around it
05:04       ravenx │  would love to see some configs.
05:04        tbuck │  ive never really used it myself just played with it
05:04       ravenx │  yes, that sounds like it.
05:05       ravenx │  locks the window in place and tiles around it.
05:05        tbuck │  i have a binding to call `bspc window -t private`
05:05        tbuck │  thats all it is really
05:05    earsplit_ │  yeah
05:05    earsplit_ │  someone requested it a while back
05:06       ravenx │  hrm tbuck ,by the sounds of it...
05:06  angelic_sed │  private makes me think of
05:06    earsplit_ │  i use it once in a while
05:06       ravenx │  bspc window -t private is more of a hotkey you stcik in sxhkd?
05:06  angelic_sed │   bspc control --toggle-visibility
05:06       ravenx │  earsplit_: is it in your config?
05:06        tbuck │  ravenx: yeah
05:06    earsplit_ │  yeah i use it once in a while
05:06       ravenx │  hm, so i would have to press a button everytime i want to make it private?
05:06        tbuck │  yeah unless you had a rule of some sort
05:07    earsplit_ │  well all it does is lock a node
05:07    earsplit_ │  basically
05:07    earsplit_ │  i'm not sure about the implementation
05:07       ravenx │  k
05:07       ravenx │  gonna experiement with it and maybe post in the bspwm thread on arch if i dont get it
05:08  angelic_sed │  ravenx: do you have your dotfiles on github?
05:08       ravenx │  yup
05:09       ravenx │  do you want to see them?
05:11  angelic_sed │  ravenx: i do
05:11       ravenx │  www.github.com/esn89/
05:11       ravenx │  i should have a scrot of what my current state looks like.
05:13    earsplit_ │  i like the panel padding
05:13       ravenx │  thank you :)
05:14    earsplit_ │  what's hogging your cpu?
05:15  angelic_sed │  thanks
05:15       ravenx │  hrm.
05:15       ravenx │  no clue, let me look
05:15  angelic_sed │  I like going through people's config files and stealing as much as I can. I did that with earsplit's the other day.
05:15       ravenx │  it may have been "at that moment"
05:15    earsplit_ │  in that screenshot
05:15    earsplit_ │  my dotfiles repo blows
05:16    earsplit_ │  it needs reorganization and a bootstrap script
05:16       ravenx │  haha
05:16       ravenx │  gave you a shout out on my dotfiles
05:16       ravenx │  hope you saw it, earsplit_
05:16    earsplit_ │  hahahaha
05:16       ravenx │  also, looking at my CPU now, it has very low usage.  might hav ebeen spur of the moment.
05:17    earsplit_ │  thanks :D
05:17       ravenx │  np :)
05:17  angelic_sed │  you should see my dotfiles
05:17       ravenx │  sure thing, i'll hvae a look.
05:17  angelic_sed │  they are totally chaotic
05:17  angelic_sed │  haha I'll post them when I clean up my vimrc
05:17       ravenx │  alrighty
05:17  angelic_sed │  btw what are you using for your vim status line?
05:17       ravenx │  vim-airline
05:18       ravenx │  it's really lightweight, and "stays-outta-your-way"
05:18  angelic_sed │  me too
05:18  angelic_sed │  mine is uglier though
05:18       ravenx │  lotsa colorschemes to pick from and has integration for plugins like syntastic and the like.
05:18       ravenx │  oh
05:18       ravenx │  use the base16 color scheme
05:18    earsplit_ │  there's also https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim
05:18  angelic_sed │  i'll check it out
05:18       ravenx │  i made that color scheme for vim-airline *shameless self promotion*
05:19  angelic_sed │  why do you have a zsh theme but a bashrc?
05:19    earsplit_ │  nice
05:19    earsplit_ │  i made airline use terminal defaults once
05:19       ravenx │  angelic_sedition: sometimes, work/school servers won't let me have root and install zsh.
05:19    earsplit_ │  but i never really looked at it so i uninstalled it
05:19       ravenx │  earsplit_: jesus, how many more clones of the powerline-eseque do we have lol
05:19       ravenx │  i remember it all started off with lokaltog's powerline, then vim-airline now this.
05:19  angelic_sed │  ravenx: I hate that
05:19    earsplit_ │  you could also write it all in the ~/.bashrc
05:19  angelic_sed │  I hate powerline
05:19    earsplit_ │  and do a `source ~/.bashrc` in your zshrc
05:20       ravenx │  earsplit_: ah, i never thought of that..
05:20    earsplit_ │  the syntax is the same for most things
05:20       ravenx │  but i use the fuck outta oh-my-zsh plugins lol
05:20    earsplit_ │  it should theoretically work
05:20    earsplit_ │  which ones?
05:20  angelic_sed │  i feel like my config files are insanely big
05:20    earsplit_ │  i only really use the left / right prompts and backwards history search in zsh
05:21  angelic_sed │  my zshrc is approaching 1.5k lines
05:21       ravenx │  angelic_sedition: you hate powerline?  look what i did over the weekend:
05:21       ravenx │  http://i.imgur.com/qNqbLGy.png
05:22       ravenx │  wtf, 1.5kline zsh? ....
05:22       ravenx │  just cuz i had too much time on my hands.
05:22    earsplit_ │  this guy loves vim plugins: https://github.com/itchyny
05:22  angelic_sed │  that actually looks pretty cool
05:22  angelic_sed │  I'm still using tmux-powerline instead of powerline
05:22    earsplit_ │  thats super nice
05:22       ravenx │  earsplit_: oh lawd.   they're multiplying.
05:22       ravenx │  is that his fulltime job haha?
05:23       ravenx │  thanks :)
05:23       ravenx │  the configs for that is hidden in https://github.com/esn89/dotfiles/tree/master/bspwm/temp
05:23  angelic_sed │  Shougo is the best
05:23       ravenx │  yes, everything he touches is Gold.
05:25    earsplit_ │  this is all i use zsh for: http://i.imgur.com/BJ6ftFO.gif
05:25    earsplit_ │  l / r and that dumb completion
05:26       ravenx │  lol
05:26       ravenx │  you know, for zsh you dont even have to type cd.
05:26       ravenx │  it has made me that lazy.
05:26    earsplit_ │  i cant do that
05:26    earsplit_ │  it'll ruin me in ssh land
05:26    earsplit_ │  i've already got the bad habit of the vim commands
05:26  angelic_sed │  do any of you use fasd?
05:27       ravenx │  hahaha, ssh-land
05:27    earsplit_ │  esc-0-i
05:27    earsplit_ │  i do it all the time instead of hitting home
05:27       ravenx │  we've all been there and had that "where the fuck am i" look
05:27       ravenx │  nope, never heard of fasd
05:27    earsplit_ │  ahahahah
05:27    earsplit_ │  first result: https://www.google.com/search?q=fasd&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
05:27    earsplit_ │  wow
05:27       ravenx │  lmao
05:27    earsplit_ │  i mean i shouldnt be laughing but
05:28    earsplit_ │  hahahahahahaha
05:28  tuftedocelo │  That got dark real fast
05:28       ravenx │  very.
05:28       ravenx │  earsplit_ is going to hell :P
05:28  angelic_sed │  heard of autojump?
05:28       ravenx │  nope
05:28    earsplit_ │  i should open an issue on github for that reason alone
05:28    earsplit_ │  there was something like this on hackernews last week
05:29    earsplit_ │  kind of like bookmarks for a shell session
05:29    earsplit_ │  i cant remember if this was it or not
05:29  angelic_sed │  i used to use bookmarks.. ranger has spoiled me though
05:30       ravenx │  what is bookmarks?
05:30       ravenx │  like tabs on your terminal?
05:30    earsplit_ │  no like
05:30  angelic_sed │  bookmarking most used directories?
05:30    earsplit_ │  instead of 'cd /vary/long/directory/structure/to/some/dumb/java/config/file'
05:31    earsplit_ │  cdb dumbjavaconfig
05:31  angelic_sed │  i do aliases
05:31  angelic_sed │  and I would do fasd if it worked
05:31       ravenx │  ah i never knew it can have that bookmarked
05:32    earsplit_ │  `cd -` is useful if you didn't know about it
05:33    earsplit_ │  switches you to the previous directory you were in
05:33       ravenx │  nice, kinda like a 'back' button in the browser then.
05:33        tbuck │  theres also `cd `
05:33        tbuck │  brings you home
05:34    earsplit_ │  i never found 'cd ~' too difficult to type
05:34        tbuck │  yeah its not really
05:34        tbuck │  lol
05:34  angelic_sed │  i have - aliased to cd -
05:35  angelic_sed │  actually might just work with auto cd though..
05:35    earsplit_ │  i was thinking about getting one of these: http://arstechnica.com/staff/2014/01/stop-trying-to-innovate-keyboards-youre-just-making-them-worse/
05:35    earsplit_ │  and then i saw the tilde key was missing
05:35  angelic_sed │  btw here's my desktop http://angelic-sedition.deviantart.com/art/Clean-Desktop-427909312?q=gallery%3Aangelic-sedition&qo=0
05:35       ravenx │  sigh, thinkpads :(
05:35       ravenx │  fallen from grace.
05:36  angelic_sed │  i just starting using bspwm the other day so I haven't really done much with bar though
05:36    earsplit_ │  its there its just where right alt usually is
05:36    earsplit_ │  less is more
05:36    earsplit_ │  there's also a few sick bar patches on github right now
05:36  angelic_sed │  all normal keyboards are terrible
05:36       ravenx │  how did you get htat molecule thingy?
05:36       ravenx │  and what molecule is that?
05:37  angelic_sed │  it's lsd
05:37    earsplit_ │  one for clickable areas, one for xinerama, and one for runtime configuration
05:37  angelic_sed │  the lsd theme for conky
05:37    earsplit_ │  still that laptop is tempting
05:38  angelic_sed │  earsplit_: can you link me to that?
05:38  angelic_sed │  what's tempting about it?
05:39    earsplit_ │  2560x1440 in a 14" laptop with integrated graphics
05:39    earsplit_ │  and a 9 hour battery life
05:39       ravenx │  the X1 carbon?
05:39    earsplit_ │  the new one
05:39       ravenx │  does it have a tactile middle click button?
05:39       ravenx │  i guess not then.
05:39       ravenx │  the new has one, big integrated trackpad.
05:40    earsplit_ │  i use the nipple
05:40  tuftedocelo │  nipple 4 lyfe
05:40  angelic_sed │  the keyboard is so bad it makes me want to puke though
05:40  angelic_sed │  what is the nipple?
05:40  tuftedocelo │  I have a current gen X1 Carbon
05:40    earsplit_ │  the little red dot in the keyboard
05:40    earsplit_ │  really?
05:40  tuftedocelo │  The TrackPoint
05:40    earsplit_ │  can you do me a solid and let me know how hot it runs?
05:40  angelic_sed │  like for mouse movement?
05:41         quit │  mossepo
05:41    earsplit_ │  yeah
05:41  tuftedocelo │  earsplit_: not very
05:41  angelic_sed │  oh
05:41  angelic_sed │  i don't do mouse movement
05:41    earsplit_ │  super useful since you dont ever have to move your hands from the keyboard
05:41    earsplit_ │  i cant live without it
05:41       ravenx │  i use the nipple as well.  but i need that middle click button.
05:41  angelic_sed │  i already don't ever have to move my hands from the keyboard
05:41  tuftedocelo │  The fan will spin up occasionally, but spin back down again
05:41  angelic_sed │  no nipple needed
05:41    earsplit_ │  angelic does the x1 not have a middle click button?
05:41    earsplit_ │  whats the output of `sensors` tell you?
05:42  angelic_sed │  other guy/girl has the x1
05:42    earsplit_ │  oh sorry i meant tuftedocel
05:42  tuftedocelo │  earsplit_: it's off right now, but I'd say it average low-mid 40s
05:43  tuftedocelo │  (also, by current gen, I meant currently available. The model that came out last year)
05:44  tuftedocelo │  (sorry if I confused you there)
05:45    earsplit_ │  ok thats good
05:45    earsplit_ │  im always worried with all those parts so close together it would get hotter
05:45       ravenx │  so dies it have the middle click?
05:46    earsplit_ │  ^ tuftedocel :D
05:46  tuftedocelo │  It does have the middle click
05:46    earsplit_ │  WOOOO
05:46  angelic_sed │  what's the middle click for
05:47    earsplit_ │  i have an x230 and i love it to death, but the screen is annoyingly small sometimes
05:47    earsplit_ │  for scrolling with the track point
05:47    earsplit_ │  instead of two finger scrolling
05:47    earsplit_ │  you hit the middle mouse with your thumb and use the track point
05:47    earsplit_ │  which is sometimes very useful
05:47  angelic_sed │  when?
05:47       ravenx │  and you and paste with it
05:47       ravenx │  and open a link in a new tab with it
05:47       ravenx │  basically, i can't live wihtout it.
05:48    earsplit_ │  those too
05:48    earsplit_ │  i never realized how much i use it
05:48  angelic_sed │  but
05:48  angelic_sed │  pentadactyl
05:48    earsplit_ │  i mean i use vimperator
05:48    earsplit_ │  yeah
05:48    earsplit_ │  but for instance tumblr
05:48    earsplit_ │  i dont want to keep repeatedly hitting the space bar
05:48    earsplit_ │  i just hold middle mouse down with my thumb and put a lil pressure on the red thing
05:48    earsplit_ │  and it goes on forever
05:48  angelic_sed │  could probably just map that to a key
05:49  angelic_sed │  i'm going to try that actually..
05:50         quit │  angelic_sedition

05:50    earsplit_ │  i dont even tihnk about it
05:50    earsplit_ │  i guess i use a combination of the trackpoint / spacebar / j,k / G and gg
05:51       ravenx │  sounds exactrly like me
05:51  angelic_sed │  can xdotool send scrolling?
05:51  angelic_sed │  i do a bunch of pageup and down which I have on a layer
05:51    earsplit_ │  you left right as i linked it i think

05:51    earsplit_ │  its just xorg
05:52  angelic_sed │  oh nice
05:52  angelic_sed │  I accidentally closed my tmux window
05:52       ravenx │  If I want the terminal with "calcurse" to be private
05:52       ravenx │  is there a way ot 'detecting' it
05:52  tuftedocelo │  Aforementioned laptop: http://i.imgur.com/GvpUp2y.jpg
05:52  angelic_sed │  oh i actually have done this already and just totally forgot
05:53       ravenx │  and have bspwm recognize it as "calcurse" and then know to private it?
05:53       ravenx │  tuftedocelot: that's a sexy laptop.
05:53  tuftedocelo │  The weight and slimness is the best thing
05:53       ravenx │  so that something we have to get soon?  until the new x1 carbon comes out and fucks us all over?
05:53    earsplit_ │  i like the new x1
05:54  tuftedocelo │  Resolution could be better, but it isn't bad 1600x900
05:54    earsplit_ │  i've got an x230 at 1366x768
05:54       ravenx │  is it IPS?
05:54  tuftedocelo │  Been there. I had an x130e at that res before my X1
05:54    earsplit_ │  i always drool over new laptops but its hard to give up
05:54    earsplit_ │  yeah its IPS
05:54    earsplit_ │  its pimped out too
05:54    earsplit_ │  1tb hdd, 256 ssd, 16gb ram
05:55    earsplit_ │  waiting on a drive replacement though my hdd died on me
05:56       ravenx │  i'm on a x201 righ tnow
05:56    earsplit_ │  thinkpad circlejerk
05:56       ravenx │  it's been 3.5 years wiht it, it's still running like it is brand new out of the box
05:56       ravenx │  i dont have the heart to get rid of it.
05:56    earsplit_ │  i think mine just needs a clean
05:56       ravenx │  cosmetics aside, it is basically new.
05:56  tuftedocelo │  I used to have a z61m, but I broke it :(
05:56    earsplit_ │  do you ever clean out the fans?
05:56       ravenx │  and i dont want to give up a non-island keyboard.
05:56    earsplit_ │  how did you break a thinkpad i thought it was impossible?
05:56       ravenx │  earsplit_: absolutely
05:57    earsplit_ │  with what? ive been meaning to do that
05:57       ravenx │  compressed air ofc.
05:57  tuftedocelo │  I took it apart trying to do a deep clean and the reassembly did not go as planned
05:57       ravenx │  another thing about thinkpads is that they are very easy to take apart
05:57       ravenx │  and reassemble.
05:57       ravenx │  tuftedocelot: ouch.
05:57    earsplit_ │  how do you keep the fan from spinning?
05:57  angelic_sed │  ywhen did thinkpads stop sucking?
05:57       ravenx │  a straigtened paperclip
05:57       ravenx │  and i also allowed it to spin most of the time, so that the dust would be come loose.
05:58       ravenx │  though, you have an x230, i dont know if that is completely different.
05:58    earsplit_ │  its a little weird
05:58    earsplit_ │  only one fan though
05:59       ravenx │  thing with the x1 carbon is that....it doesn't have a removable battery
05:59       ravenx │  and you can swap the ram out for more
05:59  tuftedocelo │  Yeah, I'll agree with you there. Luckily, the dude I got mine from maxed it out at 8GB
05:59       ravenx │  also, can you guys take a look at this x1 carbon, something is wrong with this display:  http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/#techspecs
05:59       ravenx │  tuftedocelot: though sometimes i take a step back and think " do i really need all that ram"
05:59       ravenx │  especialyl someone who runs a WM and arch lol
06:00       ravenx │  everything boots in 5 seconds, ssd or not.
06:00       ravenx │  okay i lied, maybe 7.
06:00       ravenx │  but still.
06:00  tuftedocelo │  Hehe, yeah. I think after booting, I'm at like 140MB RAM usage
06:00  angelic_sed │  I actually use a lot of ram
06:00    earsplit_ │  i do too
06:00    earsplit_ │  mysql can be a bitch
06:00  angelic_sed │  The other day I was using over 5 gigs of ram and 5 gigs of swap
06:01       ravenx │  hot damn.
06:01       ravenx │  but regarding the thinkpad i just linke dyou guys.
06:01       ravenx │  how come the display is so shitty?
06:02  tuftedocelo │  Probably the cheapest Lenovo could source at the price point they wanted to make
06:04       ravenx │  ah
06:04       ravenx │  but i thought you guys mentioned that you saw a carbon with 2k+ resolution
06:04  tuftedocelo │  That's the newly announced model
06:04  tuftedocelo │  Doesn't come out for another month or two
06:04       ravenx │  aaaah i see
06:05       ravenx │  so i get a choice between pixels, or a middle click.
06:05       ravenx │  FUUUCK  YOU, LENOVO.
06:05       ravenx │  FUCK YOU TOO IBM FOR SELLING IT
06:05  tuftedocelo │  ibm, y. y u do dis
06:05  angelic_sed │  pixels any day
06:06  tuftedocelo │  Does the Chromebook Pixel have a middle click?
06:06       ravenx │  nope
06:07       ravenx │  it also has fucked up ctrl/alt/fn buttons
06:07       ravenx │  and plus, the biggest size is 32gb
06:07       ravenx │  though it is very attractive.
06:07       ravenx │  doesn't it need to run archlinux in an arm6 arch?
06:07  tuftedocelo │  I believe there's a Core i5 mdoel
06:08    earsplit_ │  if you dont need power, there's always ebay
06:09  tuftedocelo │  https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Google_Chromebook_Pixel_LTE?id=chromebook_pixel_lte
06:09    earsplit_ │  ive got a friend who owns 14 thinkpad t60s
06:09    earsplit_ │  buys them for like $50
06:09    earsplit_ │  he's stocked for life
06:09  tuftedocelo │  I miss the T61p. 15" screen, but 1920x1200 display
06:09  tuftedocelo │  Mein gott
06:09    earsplit_ │  i cant deal with that big of a computer ever again
06:10  tuftedocelo │  Tell that to a guy in my class who lugs around a 17" laptop and is probably an inch or so thick
06:11  tuftedocelo │  It's one of those Dell "desktop replacement" models
06:12  angelic_sed │  Mine is only 13".. 17" might be nice :D
06:12  tuftedocelo │  You could swap one with a pavestone and I'd doubt he'd notice the difference in his bag
06:12    earsplit_ │  just get a monitor
06:12    earsplit_ │  best of both worlds
06:14  tuftedocelo │  G'night everyone. Heading to bed. Good convo tonight. 10/10 would converse with again

21:19     earsplit │  morning?!
21:19      dotpyfe │  maybe in your country
21:19     earsplit │  mysql sucks
21:19     earsplit │  its like the C of databases
21:19      dotpyfe │  how so?
21:20      dotpyfe │  c is necessary, mysql is not :P
21:20     earsplit │  it just takes some serious manual intervention
21:20     earsplit │  which is a good thing
21:20     earsplit │  but
21:21     earsplit │  i've been trying to debug the same query all morning
21:21     earsplit │  and after 4 hours found a fix
21:21      dotpyfe │  heh
21:21      dotpyfe │  as much as i dislike oracle, their sql server has some massively impressive debugging tools
21:22     earsplit │  just using the CLI client works for me
21:22     earsplit │  the problem was that someone arbitrarly named our indexes
21:22       ravenx │  sorry, i meant afternoon.
21:22       ravenx │  bored in my lectures!
21:22      dotpyfe │  oh, gross
21:22     earsplit │  so instead of the index for "count" being "count" or "index_count"
21:22     earsplit │  they're all named IDX_69420666662
21:23       ravenx │  hahaha
21:23      dotpyfe │  its totally more... uh.... secure....
21:23      dotpyfe │  >.>
21:23      dotpyfe │  <.<
21:23     earsplit │  oh i know why that is
21:23     earsplit │  nevermindddddddd
21:24       ravenx │  you at work, earsplit ?
21:24     earsplit │  yeah
21:24     earsplit │  well working from home today
21:26       ravenx │  that must be nic en cozy
21:26       ravenx │  cuppa coffee, stay in bed, headphones
21:26       ravenx │  my idea of paradise.
21:27  tuftedocelo │  earsplit: isn't that Oracle's default behavior for indices?
21:29      dotpyfe │  tuftedocelot: shouldnt be
21:29     earsplit │  no it was Doctrine
21:29     earsplit │  database wrapper for php
21:30      dotpyfe │  recommended naming scheme was somethign like IDX_<tablename>_<indexnumber>
21:31  tuftedocelo │  Aga
21:31  tuftedocelo │  *aha
21:31     earsplit │  in this case it looked like 16 bit encodings of tablename-indexnumber
21:32     earsplit │  or sorry 16 character encodings of those two things
21:32     earsplit │  just a buttpain
21:34     earsplit │  also, oracle bad, mariadb good
21:35  tuftedocelo │  Btw, what's your aur helper of choice?
21:35  tuftedocelo │  earsplit ^
21:36  tuftedocelo │  Well, everyone
21:36      dotpyfe │  we get oracle for free for the dept
21:36  tuftedocelo │  Gather round and share
21:36      dotpyfe │  so its useful in class
21:36      dotpyfe │  also - historical cruft
21:36     earsplit │  i use packer
21:36     earsplit │  just because i installed it first
21:36       ravenx │  earsplit: do you use arch for work?
21:38     earsplit │  yeah
21:38     earsplit │  everyone else has a macbook
21:38     earsplit │  lol
21:39      dotpyfe │  heh, thats how my lab meetings are
21:39      dotpyfe │  everyone on macbook, me in my 'black sheep' thinkpad
21:39  tuftedocelo │  Haha, you missed out on the thinkpad circlejerk the other night
21:39     earsplit │  nah i was here for that
21:39      dotpyfe │  think he meant me
21:39     earsplit │  oh
21:39     earsplit │  hahaha
21:39      dotpyfe │  tufty and i know each other irl
21:40      dotpyfe │  so theres oob communcation there
21:40      dotpyfe │  i was looking into buying one of those new x1 carbons
21:40      dotpyfe │  but they keybaord.... oh god why

21:40      dotpyfe │  *the

21:41      dotpyfe │  dat resolution though
21:43     earsplit │  yeah
21:43     earsplit │  i dunno with 10 workspaces 1366x768 is livable
21:43     earsplit │  it just sucks when i'm testing the website i'm making
21:43      dotpyfe │  i mean, it helps
21:43      dotpyfe │  but when im doing kernel debugging
21:43      dotpyfe │  and want to have 4+ vim or tmux panes open
21:43      dotpyfe │  it gets hairy
21:44     earsplit │  do you work on the kernel?
21:44         quit │  mossepo
21:44      dotpyfe │  sorta, i work on a vmm that is a kernel module
21:45     earsplit │  virtual memory or virtual machine?
21:45     earsplit │  and do you do that for real life or school?
21:45      dotpyfe │  latter to both
21:45      dotpyfe │  haha
21:45      dotpyfe │  purely academic
21:45      dotpyfe │  http://www.v3vee.org/palacios/
21:48     earsplit │  i use docker, which i guess uses this: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Docker
21:48     earsplit │  docker is amazing
21:49      dotpyfe │  i havent looked at it a ton
21:49     earsplit │  interesting read: http://www.slideshare.net/fasgoncalves/hypervisor-versus-linux-containers
21:49      dotpyfe │  cheers, ill take a look
21:49      dotpyfe │  where do you work?
21:50     earsplit │  rewriting an archaic website
21:50     earsplit │  for http://www.someecards.com/
21:50      dotpyfe │  oh cool
21:50     earsplit │  but i studied computer engineering in school and did a lot more low level stuff
21:50      dotpyfe │  you freelance then?
21:50     earsplit │  well this is a fulltime
21:51     earsplit │  its just me and 4 other people though
21:51     earsplit │  super startuppy
21:51     earsplit │  i wanted some experience at the top of the stack after doing C and FPGA development all of college
21:51      dotpyfe │  ah ai see
21:52      dotpyfe │  oh fpga
21:52      dotpyfe │  definitely went low level
21:52      dotpyfe │  haha
21:52     earsplit │  yeah its some cool stuff
21:52      dotpyfe │  i did ce in undergrad, but more software route
21:52      dotpyfe │  now im doing cs
21:52     earsplit │  nice
21:52     earsplit │  i was never required ot take alogrithms
21:52     earsplit │  i got very little of the CS
21:52     earsplit │  a lot more of the EE
21:52      dotpyfe │  yeah i had a bunch of catching up the first year of grad school
21:53     earsplit │  thats how i feel now

21:06     earsplit │  but it works
21:08         Clap │  I read thins but I don't get the meaning of the %i itself
21:09  tuftedocelo │  It's a placeholder for the x,y coordinates
21:10         Clap │  ok
21:11     earsplit │  it does feel a little hacky
21:12      dotpyfe │  people have too many names
21:12      dotpyfe │  though im guilty of that myself
21:12      dotpyfe │  i stole dotpyfe from tuftedocelot
21:12     earsplit │  in C %i is a format specifier for integers
21:13         Clap │  then it only means "integer" ? but who fills this placeholder next ?
21:14     earsplit │  so i'm guessing he reads in the X and Y from a scanf call somewhere

21:18         Clap │  well, in fact, %i and %i magically turn into the pointer position at run time
21:19         Clap │  i mean, sxhkd replaces this with pointer position
21:19     earsplit │  well if you wnated to generalize that for other WM's, you could use `xdotool getmouselocation`
21:22         Clap │  ok
21:23     earsplit │  are you using it with bspwm or sxhkd?

22:07  tuftedocelo │  How else are you going to do it?
22:08         Clap │  well, the window could grow equally to left and right simply by doing -> and shrinking when presing <-
22:09   rudylorren │  that will grow and shrink all windows on the screen
22:09      dotpyfe │  rudylorren: i think he meant resize the window, not the gaps (but maybe im wrong)

22:09      dotpyfe │  say the window is at an edge
22:10   rudylorren │  my mistake
22:10         Clap │  in this case, It could gro more to the other side
22:10      dotpyfe │  i suspect it would also need to work slightly differently for tiling vs floating windows
