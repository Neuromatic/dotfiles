01:38       Tanami │  perl is not for everybody
01:39         Yuai │  Python aswel.
01:39         Yuai │  Python's syntax is odd as shit.
01:40     Cyberworm│  Worm|Off
01:42       Tanami │  odd
01:42       Tanami │  you mean
01:42       Tanami │  poorly formed
01:43         Yuai │  no it's syntax is just odd
01:43         Yuai │  it's not normal like c, c++, java, c sharp, etc.
01:43       Tanami │  I beg to differ
01:43         Yuai │  How so?
01:43       Tanami │  but my explanation is long-winded and boring
01:43         Yuai │  I have time.
01:44       Tanami │  python's grammar is static and boring by definition, but aside from edge cases which are a result of poor language development python has all the typical elements of a language like C or Java
01:44       Tanami │  I am referring to
01:45       Tanami │  significant whitespace
01:45       Tanami │  function brackets ()
01:45       Tanami │  definition equivocation =
01:45       Tanami │  argument separator ,
01:45       Tanami │  etc
01:45         Yuai │  Oh, yeah.
01:45         Yuai │  But
01:45         Yuai │  like
01:45         Yuai │  "import"
01:45         Yuai │  print "hi"
01:45         Yuai │  etc
01:45         Yuai │  is not normal.
01:45         Yuai │  I think Python is nice, but it's ugly.
01:45       Tanami │  what's not normal about import
01:46       Tanami │  tbqh
01:46         Yuai │  No other languages have that exact code.
01:46         Yuai │  they're all #include 
01:46         Yuai │  they're not just
01:46         Yuai │  include
01:46       Tanami │  perl has use or require
01:46      wailord │  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUCyvw4w_yk 10/10
01:46       Tanami │  and they do different things
01:46         Yuai │  I think perl is ugly aswell.
01:46         Yuai │  I may learn it just to learn it.
01:46       Tanami │  perl has the benefit of at least making sense
01:47       Tanami │  but the dynamic grammar definitely makes perl's syntax more crazy than python
01:47         Yuai │  I think c++ is the best language.
01:48       Tanami │  I think common lisp is the best language, which is why I never use it
01:48         Yuai │  What do you perfer then?

02:34       Tanami │  if you are having trouble using wildcards for expansion
02:34       Tanami │  remember that you need them at the start and end unless you have defined it

01:23      wailord │  <3
01:23      wailord │  what did he say?
01:23      wailord │  i generally ignore him
01:23    Naughtsee │  welp
01:23      Scope10 │  Bad font rendering
01:23    Naughtsee │  the truth comes out
01:24      wailord │  i'm not sure how to fix that :(
01:24      wailord │  i can't even tell
01:24      Scope10 │  Has anyone ever seen a website that uses bitmap fonts in their design?
01:24      Scope10 │  Or in their logo
01:24         kori │  Scope10: what
01:24      Scope10 │  kori, my point exactly
01:24         kori │  I meant for gtk
01:25         kori │  for terminals it has always been tewi
01:25      Scope10 │  Does any modern design ever used bitmap fonts?
01:25    Naughtsee │  Scope10: no. ofc not
01:25      Scope10 │  Well, why would that be?
01:25    Naughtsee │  cuz they're unattractive
01:25      Scope10 │  Yes
01:26      Scope10 │  Yet people still use them on everything on their desktop
01:26      Scope10 │  And I don't see the appeal
01:26    Naughtsee │  why would you use an sans-serif in your terminal?
01:26    Naughtsee │  antialiased
01:26      Scope10 │  I'm not saying in terminal
01:26    Naughtsee │  I use it in my panel
01:26      Scope10 │  I'm talking about design in general
01:26      Scope10 │  Why tho
01:28    Naughtsee │  looks nice

01:29    Naughtsee │  I mean, I'm not bothered by it, especially if I just post it
01:29      Scope10 │  Dun know
01:29    Naughtsee │  so idk why everyone does
01:29      Scope10 │  Because it says it in the terminal
01:29    Naughtsee │  and in thunar
01:30    Naughtsee │  you don't think the bitmapped font looks nice ?
01:30         kori │  Naughtsee: James is a nice name
01:31    Naughtsee │  It's the most common name in America iirc

06:16         kori │  look for something like
06:16         kori │  WITH_PKGNG = yes
06:16      wailord │  oh
06:16      wailord │  yeah
06:17      wailord │  you got it
06:17         kori │  is that correct?
06:17      wailord │  you put that in make.conf i think
06:17         kori │  k
06:17   xDemonessx │  you should watch this show if you havent
06:17         kori │  are you sure it's yes and not YES
06:17      wailord │  not sure
06:17         kori │  check
06:17         noha │  i always get 3-4 episodes through champloo then stop watching it
06:17         noha │  i'm not sure why
06:17      wailord │  However, pkgng can coexist with from-source builds of ports by adding the line WITH_PKGNG=yes to /etc/make.conf. This will cause the newly built and installed ports to be registered properly in the pkgng database. While this is an excellent (and very much needed) idea when there is a need for some specific flags and options in ports's builds, it requires special care when upgrading with pkgng.

06:20      wailord │  How do I use hal on FreeBSD?
06:20      wailord │  The only thing you need to do in order to use hal is to start the HAL daemon, hald. To do this, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:
06:20      wailord │  dbus_enable="YES"
06:20      wailord │  hald_enable="YES"

19:57         kori │  and this time, patch it for xft FIRST
19:57         kori │  then the other patches
19:57         mobo │  I have no other patches
19:58         kori │  how did you patch it
19:58         mobo │  git
19:58         kori │  :/
19:58         kori │  I didn't use git 
19:58         mobo │  what did you use?
19:58         kori │  patch -Np1 < patch.diff
19:58         mobo │  I guess I'll try that
19:59         mobo │  it's just frozen 
20:00         kori │  just backup your config.h and create a new dwm
20:00         kori │  and don't use git
20:00         kori │  because your dwm.c is already dirty
20:00         mobo │  I made a copy of all my dwm files before I patched originally
20:00         mobo │  and I'm using that

20:01         kori │  what command are you running
20:01         mobo │  same one that you used
20:01         kori │  you're using the patch name correctly right
20:02         mobo │  yeah
20:02         kori │  then it shouldnt be frozen
20:02         mobo │  is it supposed to take more than 2 minutes?
20:02         kori │  no
20:02         mobo │  agh

19:29         kori │  they don't have a stance on software freedom
19:29         kori │  they basically taped the distro together

19:30         kori │  tbh even for that i wouldnt use crunchbang

19:31         kori │  eOS prob
19:31      Scope10 │  Bloated
19:31         kori │  actually its one of the lightest linux distros

19:31      Scope10 │  >polished = light
19:31      Scope10 │  OSX must take the first place, right?
19:31         tibs │  I used #! to install Funtoo this time around

13:41         tibs │  I coulden;t find any decently priced 7200 RPM SSHDs
13:42         tibs │  They were all 5200
13:42         tibs │  Do not want
13:42   brushdemon │  Yeah, don't blame you
13:42   brushdemon │  lol, I have one of those SSD's on the PC i'm using right now
13:42   brushdemon │  well the 256gb version when they sold themm
13:43   brushdemon │  But danm they've gone down in price a heap since this time last year
13:43         tibs │  Indeed, I'll buy one when they reach HDD prices
13:43   brushdemon │  Good drives though tibs
13:43         tibs │  Which?
13:44   brushdemon │  the Corsair GS
13:44         tibs │  Yeah
13:44   brushdemon │  and I use a 7200 black for backups
13:44   brushdemon │  also pretty good
13:44         tibs │  Can't afford to drop that much on a drive right now though, with all my court costs and whatnot
13:45   brushdemon │  I know the feel, I moved states and need to find another part time job. Just enrolled into college again
13:45   brushdemon │  but why the court cases?
13:45         tibs │  $65 a session for my mandatory counseling
13:45         tibs │  Because my BAC was too high last year
13:45   brushdemon │  DUI?
13:46         tibs │  Not that bad, but yes
13:46   brushdemon │  ahhh man, that sucks
13:46         tibs │  Thought I was under the limit
13:46         tibs │  My bad
13:46         tibs │  Haha
13:46   brushdemon │  hahaha
13:46   brushdemon │  how far over where you anyways?
13:46   brushdemon │  like 0.0001 or something?
13:46         tibs │  Legal here is 0.08, I blew 0.13
13:47         tibs │  So 0.05 over
13:47   brushdemon │  Not sure if you're just a professional drunk or if you just always feel drunk
13:47         tibs │  I drink a lot of beer
13:47         tibs │  Hard for me to tell
13:47         tibs │  I felt fine
13:47   brushdemon │  hahaha
13:48         tibs │  I'm pretty sure I WAS fine, still don't know why I got pulled over
13:48   brushdemon │  I went through a stage like that in 2012. Luckily I was way too broke to afford a car
13:48   brushdemon │  Wait, you just got RBT'd for no actual reason?
13:48         tibs │  Yup
13:48   brushdemon │  da fuq
13:48         tibs │  Cop claimed I was speeding
13:48         tibs │  I know I was not
13:48         join │  vosh
13:48         tibs │  As I was using cruise control
13:48   brushdemon │  Revenue raising like that is what actually pisses me off
13:49         quit │  anshin
13:49         vosh │  hi
13:49   brushdemon │  hey
13:49         tibs │  Sup
13:49   brushdemon │  My brother riced his car. It's funny the amount of times he's apparently 'speeding' and in the end it's just the cops trying to pin him for something
13:49         tibs │  Haha
13:50         tibs │  I was the only fucker on the road
13:50         tibs │  Pretty sure that was why I was pulled over
13:50   brushdemon │  Oh wow, yeah they were going to pin you for something anyway then
13:50         tibs │  Plus I was literally right next to the police station
13:50         tibs │  My ride to the cell took 25 seconds
13:50   brushdemon │  then need the $$ so fill up their cars
13:50   brushdemon │  That's GOLD
13:50         tibs │  Of course they woulden't just let me park my car at the station
13:51   brushdemon │  At least your car didn't get drug inspected
13:51         tibs │  Impounded, $300 to get it out next day
13:51   brushdemon │  that shits annoying
13:51         tibs │  I had no drugs anyway
13:52   brushdemon │  $300? That's pretty cheap
13:52   brushdemon │  over here it's like $1500 or something
13:52         tibs │  I quit carrying around my pipes last time I got fucked for that
13:52         tibs │  Haha
13:52   brushdemon │  hahaha xD
13:53   brushdemon │  I remember the last time I got pulled over I was in a similar scenario
13:53         join │  handuel
13:53   brushdemon │  Only car on the road, pulled over for no reason
13:53         tibs │  I guess I'm going to make a habit out of waiting 6 hours after my beers to drive now
13:53         tibs │  Considering buying my own breathalizer
13:53   brushdemon │  They TRIED to get me. They had nothing on me and tried writing me a ticket for speeding
13:54   brushdemon │  I have an onboard cam which records my speed
13:54         tibs │  Haha
13:54   brushdemon │  took it to court
13:54   brushdemon │  cop had to apologise to me
13:54   brushdemon │  best day
13:54   brushdemon │  Wait... they sell breathalizers?
13:54         tibs │  Yeah
13:54         tibs │  You can buy the same ones the cops use
13:54   brushdemon │  O
13:55   brushdemon │  I think i'll need one of those... actually not really since I quit drinking like a year ago now
13:55   brushdemon │  but still
13:55         tibs │  Amusingly, all I can do right now is drink
13:55         tibs │  Random drug tests and all that
13:56   brushdemon │  Don't drink, keep drinking money saved, buy SSD, fuck bitches
13:56   brushdemon │  Lifes sweet
13:56         tibs │  I haven't been buying shit
13:56         tibs │  My buddies always have beer though
13:57   brushdemon │  Free beer
13:57   brushdemon │  yeah, I don't blame you then for taking up :P
13:57   brushdemon │  You're from the states tibs?
13:58         tibs │  Yeah, Michigan, near Detroit
13:58   brushdemon │  North side. I was going to say that over here is Aus we have our 'National Day'
13:59   brushdemon │  Pretty much they made it a long weekend because the amount of people hung over on the Monday is phenomenal
13:59         tibs │  Haha
13:59         tibs │  I rarely get hungover
13:59   brushdemon │  I was going to say if you're over here you'd fit right in this weekend :P
13:59         tibs │  Based liver

14:00   brushdemon │  Haha
14:00         tibs │  Also black spiced rum
14:00   brushdemon │  I know the feel
14:00   brushdemon │  Spirits get me hard
14:01   brushdemon │  especially when somebody pulls out the tequila
14:01         tibs │  Vodka never gives me problems
14:01         quit │  liam
14:01   brushdemon │  last time I did that I woke up next to a girl I didn't know, had a pack of cigars and somehow obtained a fedora
14:01         tibs │  Save for the time I drank half a fifth and decided that was a good time to drop acid
14:01   brushdemon │  any drug + alcohol = not fun
14:01         tibs │  I awoke hugging a toilet
14:02   brushdemon │  At least you didn't wake up being everthing that /g/ seems to hate
14:02         tibs │  Aparently I freaked one guy out so hard he left and walked 15 miles home
14:02   brushdemon │  hahahahaha xD
14:02   brushdemon │  You remember any of it?
14:02         tibs │  Barely
14:02         tibs │  Bits and pieces
14:03         tibs │  Buddy said, I would sit on the floor saying "Is this it? Is this all there is?"
14:03         tibs │  "So this is it."
14:03         tibs │  etc

00:38         st4g │  "It's not much but it's something different for now whilst I work on some more stuff." yeah, I plan to add more

00:43     Demoness │  kori: I would be all over samurize if only it wasn't more dated that bblean.
00:43     Demoness │  I guess it's fine if you avoid using it as a panel, but still I wish it had unicode support.
00:44     Demoness │  Speaking of, the new version of bblean has btsetbg bugged (Cant set images as backgrounds) and systembarEX doesn't support unicode either
00:44     Demoness │  so consider this if you decide to change builds
00:44         st4g │  Demoness, you know the icons I was using in my panel before?
00:45         st4g │  I manually put them into my wallpaper so I didn't have to deal with adding them into rainmeter

02:36      wailord │  *IRC
02:37     FullDive │  ? It took me about 3 hours to get ncmpcpp + mpd configured
02:37     FullDive │  (Mainly because it kept breaking

02:37      wailord │  top hue
02:37      wailord │  you didn't do it right

02:37         join │  Nura
02:37     FullDive │  THen it turned out that it's because it was looking in the directory of the super not mine, because I'd used ~/ instead of explicityl doing /home/saki ;_;

02:38      wailord │  that's hilarious
02:38     FullDive │  (We spent an hour figuring that out)

02:38      wailord │  lamo
02:38     FullDive │  Before giving up for the night.
02:39     FullDive │  Turned out that I'd forgot to add a line to my mpd.conf
02:39      wailord │  why do you want a visualizer?
02:39      wailord │  especially the default one
02:39      wailord │  it's a resource hog, and it looks bad
02:39     FullDive │  Eh, I like it, somewhat.
02:39     FullDive │  It freezes a lot though.
02:40      wailord │  if you ask rincewind@rizon he has the link to a binary for a nicer visualizer
02:40     FullDive │  Naw, I've broken enough shit in this laptop fro the time being.
