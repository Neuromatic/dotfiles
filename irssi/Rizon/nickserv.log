11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Syntax: REGISTER password [email]
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Registers your nickname in the NickServ database.  Once
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) your nick is registered, you can use the SET and ACCESS
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) commands to configure your nick's settings as you like
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) them.  Make sure you remember the password you use when
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) registering - you'll need it to make changes to your nick
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) later.  (Note that case matters!  ANOPE, Anope, and
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) anope are all different passwords!)
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Guidelines on choosing passwords:
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Passwords should not be easily guessable.  For example,
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) using your real name as a password is a bad idea.  Using
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) in fact, NickServ will not allow it.  Also, short
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) The parameter email is not optional on this
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) network and is used to verify that you are who you
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) say you are though a simple confirmation e-mail.
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Your privacy is respected; this e-mail won't be given to
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) any third-party person.
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) This command also creates a new group for your nickname,
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) that will allow you to register other nicks later sharing
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) the same configuration, the same set of memos and the
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) same channel privileges. For more information on this
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) feature, type /msg NickServ HELP GROUP.
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Nicknames that are not identified to for 90 days automatically
11:37 NickServ (service@rizon.net) expire and are dropped from services.
11:38  > help group
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Syntax: GROUP target password
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) This command makes your nickname join the target nickname's
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) group. password is the password of the target nickname.
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Joining a group will allow you to share your configuration,
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) memos, and channel privileges with all the nicknames in the
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) group, and much more!
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) A group exists as long as it is useful. This means that even
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) if a nick of the group is dropped, you won't lose the
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) shared things described above, as long as there is at
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) least one nick remaining in the group.
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) You can use this command even if you have not registered
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) your nick yet. If your nick is already registered, you'll
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) need to identify yourself before using this command. Type
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) /msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more information. This
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) last may be not possible on your IRC network.
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) It is recommended to use this command with a non-registered
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) nick because it will be registered automatically when
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) using this command. You may use it with a registered nick (to
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) change your group) only if your network administrators allowed
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) it.
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) You can only be in one group at a time. Group merging is
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) not possible.
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net)  
11:38 NickServ (service@rizon.net) Note: all the nicknames of a group have the same password.
